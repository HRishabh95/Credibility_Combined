Home News Medical Coronavirus: It\u2019s Time to Debunk Claims That Vitamin C Could Cure It Coronavirus: It\u2019s Time to Debunk Claims That Vitamin C Could Cure It In the midst of the novel coronavirus outbreak, some \u201cinfluencers\u201d are claiming that taking mega-doses of vitamin C can cure COVID-19. The Conversation Published 9 March 2020 Image via SOMMAI / Shutterstock This article by Peter McCaffery is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors. Vitamin C is a common remedy that some people believe will cure the common cold and flu. Although it helps us maintain good immune function, there\u2019s little evidence that it can prevent or substantially reduce either of these diseases. But in the midst of the novel coronavirus outbreak, some \u201cinfluencers\u201d are claiming that taking mega-doses of vitamin C can cure COVID-19 (the disease caused by novel coronavirus). So let\u2019s cut to the chase. Can vitamin C cure the coronavirus? Considering that novel coronavirus belongs to the same family of viruses \u2013 coronaviruses \u2013 as the common cold and flu, it\u2019s unlikely that taking vitamin C will prevent or cure you of a COVID-19 infection. I have written before that using vitamin C to treat the common cold was an idea popularised by double Nobel Prize-winning chemist, Linus Pauling, and further promoted by the dietary supplements industry. Unfortunately, ever since Pauling\u2019s claim in the 1970s, there has been little evidence to back it up. Vitamins or \u201cvital-amines\u201d were first discovered at the beginning of the 20th century as elements present in low amounts in our diets that were vital for health. Certainly, people lacking certain vitamins will develop deficiency diseases. For example, people deficient in vitamin C will develop scurvy. However, it wasn\u2019t until the early 1930s that it was discovered that scurvy was caused by lack of vitamin C, and that taking the vitamin could cure the disease. The science of nutrition was born with the discovery of vitamins, and has since become a competitive, unregulated industry, often with scientific fact competing against those spreading misinformation and looking to profit: the novel coronavirus outbreak is just the latest example. These misleading articles have spread quickly, and are likely to be behind the shortage of vitamin C in Asia and a five-fold spike in demand for vitamin C and multivitamins in Singapore. The body\u2019s immune function Vitamin C is important to maintain \u201credox\u201d balance in the body\u2019s tissues \u2013 these are types of reactions in cells that add or remove oxygen, and are essential for many processes such as generating energy in cells. These same reactions, though, can create products harmful to human cells \u2013 such as reactive oxygen species, which react with lipids (fat), proteins and nucleic acids. Vitamin C can lessen these harmful reactions. It also help enzymes build collagen, which is necessary for supporting our body\u2019s tissues. Although vitamin C doesn\u2019t have miraculous disease-curing properties, some research has also shown it can help the immune system fight off bacteria and viruses. Its role in protecting against viral infections was shown in a recent review which found that immune cells need vitamin C to produce proteins that activate the immune system throughout the body against virus attacks. Having said that, we can easily obtain sufficient levels of vitamin C in our diet that will keep our immune system fully functional. Vitamin C is plentiful in many fruits and vegetables, including oranges, broccoli and potatoes. And while it is relatively non-toxic, since its high water solubility makes it easy to excrete from the body, excessive doses can result in unpleasant symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea and cramps. Study\u2019s have only seen a slight decrease in cold medication after taking vitamin C. fizkes/ Shutterstock Though I have said vitamin C is unlikely to be a dramatic cure for COVID-19, the fact that it can promote good immune function means it would be going too far to say there will be no effect. And although a review found that vitamin C has no effect on reducing the frequency of colds, it did find that for the average person, there was a small decrease in the duration of common cold symptoms. But for people that participate in brief periods of severe physical exercise (such as marathon runners and skiers), vitamin C halved the duration and severity of their common cold risk. These slight effects of vitamin C on the coronavirus that causes the common cold have spurred a new clinical trial looking to cure COVID-19 infections using very high intravenous doses of vitamin C. These trials have just started and no results are yet posted. Intravenous application of vitamin C will result in much higher and faster levels of the vitamin in the blood than any amount found in vitamin C supplements taken orally. Though this approach could increase vitamin C\u2019s mild protective effect, this is yet hypothetical and intravenous injection comes with its own risks, such as infection, blood vessel damage, air embolism or blood clots. So alhough vitamin C does have some small effect on the common cold, it\u2019s unlikely that taking large amounts of vitamin C supplements will cure a COVID-19 infection \u2013 or have a large effect at all. Even if intravenous vitamin C works to shorten or cure COVID-19, it will likely only be a stop-gap before therapies directed at the virus, such as vaccinations, take over. The most effective way to avoid the virus still remains washing hands, not touching the eyes, nose or mouth, and keeping your distance from anyone exhibiting symptoms.

COVID-19 Impact on Vitamin D Ingredients Market Adapting to the recent novel COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global Vitamin D Ingredients market is included in the present report. The influence of the novel coronavirus pandemic on the growth of the Vitamin D Ingredients market is analyzed and depicted in the report. By Market Players: Recording the highest CAGR both in terms of value and volume, the Vitamin D3 segment is the undoubted leader in the product type segment The Vitamin D3 product type segment was estimated to account for more than 70% value share in 2016, while the Vitamin D2 product type segment was estimated to hold close to 30% value share in 2016. This segment is expected to lose more than 600 BPS during 2016 \u2013 2026 and is expected to account for more than 20% value share by 2026. The Vitamin D3 segment is forecast to be valued at more than US$ 2,000 Mn by the end of 2026, registering a CAGR of 12.0% between 2016 and 2026. In 2015, the total demand for Vitamin D3 stood at more than 7,000 Tonnes in terms of volume, which is expected to increase to more than 23,000 Tonnes by 2026, recording a CAGR of 11.6% in terms of volume over the period of forecast. In terms of volume consumption, the Vitamin D3 segment accounted for the highest share in 2015 and is expected to remain dominant over the forecast period. In terms of volume growth, the Vitamin D3 product type segment is anticipated to grow 2.99X over the forecast period. Increasing cases of diseases caused by Vitamin D deficiency likely to fuel the growth of the Vitamin D3 segment Diseases such as rickets are growing globally, directing a sharp rise in Vitamin D3 and D2 consumption. Vitamin D3 and D2 is consumed through medicines owing to unavailability of a vaccine for the disease. Now-a-days, Vitamin D deficiency is becoming a common threat due to little exposure to sunlight coupled with poor eating habits. The working class population across the globe spends most of the daytime hours at the workplace, which reduces their vitamin D3 and D2 intake. People living in urban cities are more susceptible to vitamin D3 and D2 deficiency as compared to people living in rural areas. This factor is creating robust development in the Vitamin D3 product type segment. Consumers prefer Vitamin D drinks due to their cultural preferences for beverages. Demand for Vitamin D3 and D2 based beverages such as the different types of fortified drinks, juices, and water is on the rise owing to the preference factor. Demand for energy drinks and sports drinks is also playing a significant role in boosting revenue growth of the Vitamin D3 segment. High demand for these drinks globally due to increased attention towards physical fitness and sports activities is likely to boost market growth of the Vitamin D3 and D2 product type segments of the global Vitamin D ingredients market. Recommendations of various regulatory agencies regarding the intake of Vitamin D have given a boost to the Vitamin D3 and D2 segments owing to a rising awareness of diseases and problems related to Vitamin D deficiency. Likewise, easy availability of raw materials is also expected to drive the growth of these segments, eventually fuelling the growth of the global Vitamin D ingredients market. Vitamin D3 segment is expected to expand at 12.1% CAGR during the forecast period in the North America Vitamin D ingredients market The Vitamin D3 segment was estimated to account for a market share of more than 70% in 2016 in the North America Vitamin D ingredients market and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 12.1% from 2016 to 2026, in terms of value.

According to Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the answer could be \u201cyes.\u201d Advertisement - story continues below The commonplace item that he believes can help reduce risk in the midst of the pandemic is vitamin D. Frieden, who served as CDC director from 2009 to 2017, is now president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, a firm that works to prevent pandemics and lessen their impacts worldwide. \u201cThere are many crackpot claims about miracle cures floating around, but the science supports the possibility \u2014 although not the proof \u2014 that Vitamin D may strengthen the immune system, particularly of people whose Vitamin D levels are low,\u201d he wrote in a Monday Op-Ed for Fox News.

Adequate Vitamin D may potentially provide some modest protection for vulnerable populations.

One such claim has gained traction online in recent days: that high doses of vitamin C could cure coronavirus infections. The claim: High doses of Vitamin C effectively treat coronavirus As researchers around the globe race to find effective treatments for the novel coronavirus, unfounded medical advice for how to cure COVID-19 has spread rapidly on social media. One such claim has gained traction online in recent days: that high doses of vitamin C could cure coronavirus infections. The claim has been shared and reposted on Facebook by users anxious for remedies and preventative measures against the rapidly spreading viral outbreak. But, there is no evidence that the studies alluded to on social media are real, nor is there any scientific backing for the fundamental claim regarding vitamin C. What the experts say: There is no evidence that Vitamin C helps treat COVID-19 There is no scientific research supporting the claim that taking high doses of vitamin C could help prevent or cure COVID-19. Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization state that the only way to minimize the chances of contracting the virus is to take preventative steps against infection. Social distancing from other people, frequent washing of hands and the cleaning of often-used surfaces are the only techniques on which there is expert consensus that they minimize the likelihood of contracting the novel coronavirus. \u201cThere is some reason to hypothesize that some vitamins and supplements could reduce the risk and severity of COVID-19 because of benefits seen for other viral or respiratory disease,\u201d Dr. Walter Willett, a professor at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, told USA TODAY. Willett also advised that avoiding smoking, eating healthy foods, exercising and maintaining low stress levels are all important lifestyle practices in general and the only surefire ways of building up one\u2019s immune system during a pandemic crisis. \u201cAll this said, it is critical to emphasize that the focus of preventing COVID-19 should be social distancing, washing hands, and not touching our faces,\u201d Willett continued. Vitamin C has been shown to help reduce the severity of cold and flu illnesses in some trials, though this finding is widely debated by experts. The effect of taking the vitamin is also significantly less than many might expect. \u201cThe only impact that vitamins and supplements may have in any cold or flu is to lessen the severity,\u201d Dr. Caroline Apovian, a professor of medicine and pediatrics at the Boston University School of Medicine, told USA TODAY. \u201cIn general, eating well and sleeping well will help your immune system; stress and anxiety and lack of sleep depresses the immune system,\u201d she continued. A research team at Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China, began a study on vitamin C treatments for COVID-19 on Feb. 14. The program is expected to be completed at the end of September. No findings have been published. \u201cAlthough vitamin C does have some small effect on the common cold, it\u2019s unlikely that taking large amounts of vitamin C supplements will cure a COVID-19 infection \u2014 or have a large effect at all,\u201d wrote Peter McCaffery, a professor of biochemistry at the University of Aberdeen, for The Conversation. Furthermore, some experts argue that advising people to take such high doses of vitamins and supplements can be harmful, as even essential nutrients like vitamin C can produce side effects if ingested in extremely high doses. Our ruling: False We rate the claim that vitamin C can help cure or prevent the novel coronavirus FALSE because it is not supported by our research. While there is a clinical trial being conducted to determine if there is an effect on the severe present in some cases of COVID-19, the study is ongoing. Vitamin C does have marginal benefits for minimizing the effects of cold and flu viruses, however, there is no reason to believe, according to experts, that these benefits also obtain with regard to COVID-19.

According to Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the answer could be \u201cyes.\u201d Advertisement - story continues below The commonplace item that he believes can help reduce risk in the midst of the pandemic is vitamin D.

People are falsely claiming that vitamin C cures the coronavirus. Here\u2019s what you need to know. By Business Insider - April 3, 2020 caption Wellness influencers have been claiming vitamin C can prevent Covid-19. source Getty Sales of vitamin C have soared globally, following misleading claims that vitamin C could prevent or treat coronavirus infections. Two clinical trials on the effects of vitamin C on the new coronavirus are underway, in China and Italy, but no results have been found yet. Visit Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories. There are no pills, vaccines, or supplements that can cure COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which has spread around the world, killing more than 50,000 people, infecting over 1 million, and causing a global shutdown. But that hasn\u2019t stopped orange juice sales from soaring as people look to get more vitamin C in their diet, and it hasn\u2019t stopped vitamin supplement businesses from making a killing, and it certainly hasn\u2019t stopped wellness influencers from telling their followers to take potentially lethal doses of the vitamin. Google Trends shows that interest in \u2018coronavirus vitamin C\u2019 reached a crescendo by the end of March, as hundreds of thousands of desperate people grasped for solutions. Sales of vitamin C increased 146% in America as people began stocking up, while Asia and Singapore anticipated a vitamin shortage. Vitamin C doesn\u2019t reduce the risk of a cold, but it may make it milder Vitamin C is one of the most popular vitamin supplements in the US. The association between vitamin C and the ability to fend off disease was made by a Nobel prize winning chemist named Linus Pauling, who wrote a book called Vitamin C and the Common Cold, recommending 3,000 milligrams of vitamin C daily. The book was a bestseller, reissued in 1973 with a promise to ward off a swine flu epidemic. Many studies followed, showing Pauling\u2019s claims were inaccurate. By the time Pauling claimed vitamin C could cure cancer, he had lost all credibility in the scientific community. Yet the belief that vitamin C could fight off a cold remained steadfast, and by 2013, according to a Gallup poll, half of all Americans were taking vitamins regularly. According to the NIH, vitamin C doesn\u2019t reduce the risk of getting a cold, but people who take vitamin C may have slightly shorter or milder colds. The immune system is too complex to be \u2018boosted\u2019 by one vitamin When the coronavirus hit the US, wellness influencers began promoting vitamins to their audiences as a \u201cbooster\u201d to the immune system. As Insider previously reported, one nurse practitioner and YouTuber said his clinic would give people with the virus a high dose shot of vitamin D3 and IV infusions of vitamin C megadoses. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a general booster,\u201d nutrition researcher Kamal Patel, of independent nutrition database Examine.com, told Insider. Patel compared the immune system to missile alert system, dedicated on keeping anything dangerous out. If the immune system is oversensitized, autoimmune reactions will result. If it\u2019s undersensitized, people might be more susceptible to infection. \u201cThe immune system is one of the most complex and finely tuned things we know of,\u201d Patel said in an email to Insider. \u201cSo, unfortunately, you can\u2019t use broad-spectrum \u201cboosters\u201d to just make things work overall better.\u201d Hospitals are giving COVID-19 patients vitamin C because their levels are running low. It does not mean it\u2019s a \u2018cure.\u2019 New York hospitals began treating patients with vitamin C, based on reports that it\u2019s helped people in China. The doses are 16 times the recommended daily dose. \u201cThe patients who received vitamin C did significantly better than those who did not get vitamin C,\u201d Northwell Health critical care specialist Dr. Andrew G. Weber told the New York Post. Patel says the reason that works is because, when people get really sick, their vitamin C levels get depleted and may need replenishing. \u201cHumans are one of the only mammals who don\u2019t make their own vitamin C \u2013 they have to ingest it,\u201d he told Insider. \u201cSo when we encounter severe physiological stress, vitamin C through IV is a possibility for reducing runaway oxidation and inflammation.\u201d There\u2019s research that suggests there\u2019s some benefit to giving patients on ventilators vitamin C, but scientists don\u2019t know it will react with Covid-19. Clinical trials on the effects of vitamin C on the new coronavirus are underway There are at least two clinical trials testing vitamin C\u2019s effects on the new coronavirus, one in Italy and one in China. In Hubei, China, 140 COVID-19 patients with pneumonia, will take 12 grams of vitamin C via IV to see if the dose will help them fight off the disease. It is not recommended that anyone try to replicate the trial themselves: getting vitamins via IV is different from consuming a handful of pills, and taking that much vitamin C without a doctor\u2019s supervision could be lethal. In an Italian study, 500 patients will get 10 grams of vitamin C. They\u2019re still recruiting. When it comes to the coronavirus, vitamin C deficiency might put people more at risk of getting the disease because of an impaired immune system. However, Miryam Wahrman, author of The Hand Book: Surviving in a Germ-Filled World, and biology professor at William Paterson University, told Insider that, as of now, there are no studies showing vitamin C can protect against coronavirus. One study briefly touched on the relationship between vitamin C and lower respiratory issues, suggesting \u201ca moderate amount of vitamin C supplementation may be a way to prevent COVID-19.\u201d Wahrman told Insider that this \u201cis quite a stretch, and by no means a scientifically supported notion.\u201d Patel advises people not to take excessive amounts of vitamins from supplements, and not to try their own IV treatments, but instead \u201cto get vitamin C from foods high in it, given the unknowns right now.\u201d Business Insider Popular Articles Zoom\u2019s security and privacy problems are snowballing Meet Eric Yuan, the founder and CEO of Zoom, who has made nearly $4 billion in 3 months as usage of his video conferencing software skyrockets amid th... 32 of the funniest photos of animals that were taken at the perfect time I\u2019m a loyal iPhone user, but I switched to Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S20 and found 5 things I liked better compared to the iPhone 11 Pro 2 top French doctors said on live TV that coronavirus vaccines should be tested on poor Africans, leaving viewers horrified * Copyright \u00a9 2017 Business Insider Inc.

As Covid-19 became a global pandemic, the information about it started spreading everywhere. Some true, some misleading. We still don't know a lot about coronavirus. Doctors, researchers, and scientists are working on this virus trying their best to learn something new every single day. From how the virus spreads and works to how it's transmitted to finding a cure. We know the do's and the don'ts, basic things to prevent coronavirus, the way to strengthen our immunity, social distancing, and physical exercises to self-isolation. We know the primary things but as we stay home, more questions arise about safety as how to sanitize things and disinfect our homes.\u00a0 Information plays an essential role but learning the facts and debunking myths is what will keep us healthy, fit and safe. Trust source like WHO. Government Officials, The United Nations (UN), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India,\u00a0provide\u00a0authentic information which is the need of the hour.\u00a0 Myths and false information during the crisis only add on to the trouble. An ideal way to deal during this time is to cross-check information. In order to prevent the same here's a list of myth-buster from official sources like WHO, UN, Government of India and many more.\u00a0 Here are 23 facts that will debunk\u00a0the myths and answer all your questions: \u00a0 Also Read: Coronavirus: 6 Nutrition, Vitamins & Supplements Tips to Strengthen Your Immunity Coronavirus: 20 Do's and Don'ts To Stay Safe, Fit & Healthy Coronavirus: 6 Workouts You Can Do At Home To Stay In Good Shape Coronavirus: 14 Tips To Follow While Withdrawing Money From Banks and ATMs Coronavirus Preventions: 6 Practical Tips to Follow Without Shutting off Yourself from the World Start Slideshow 23 Facts That Will Deflate All the Myths about Coronavirus 1. Hot And Humid Climates Kill The Virus Image credit: WHO Doesn't matter what area you live in, COVID-19 can be transmitted in all kind of areas. Be it hot or humid climate make sure you have adopted protective measures. Keep washing your hands with soap and water or sanitize regularly. Avoid touching your face to stay away from infection. Next Slide 23 Facts That Will Deflate All the Myths about Coronavirus 2. Consuming Eggs And Chicken Spreads COVID-19 Image credit: WHO Many of us have stopped the consumption of meat and egg under the assumption that it spreads the virus. Scientists are yet to discover if there is any relation between the two. However, avoid eating animals that have died of any disease.\u00a0 Next Slide 23 Facts That Will Deflate All the Myths about Coronavirus 3. Cold Weather And Snow Cannot Kill Coronavirus Image credit: WHO There are messaging going around that cold weather can kill the virus. Let's clear it for once and for all, no evidence has come to light that proves aforesaid. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C, no matter what the external temperature or weather is. The only way to get rid of germs and viruses is by keeping your hands clean. Next Slide 23 Facts That Will Deflate All the Myths about Coronavirus 4. Hot Bath/Shower Does Not Prevent Coronavirus Image credit: WHO Do you think the one suffering from coronavirus would not have taken a hot bath? Hot water on your body surely does not safeguard you from the virus. As mentioned before, our body temperature remains constant. Anything extremely hot can burn you, be it soup or water.\u00a0 Next Slide 23 Facts That Will Deflate All the Myths about Coronavirus 5. Products Coming From China Can Infect You Image credit: Pixabay This virus cannot last long on packages and letters so it is safe to use products from China, says WHO. However, in case you still fear, sanitize the product before using it.\u00a0 Next Slide 23 Facts That Will Deflate All the Myths about Coronavirus 6. Can It Be Transmitted Through Mosquito Bite Image credit: WHO There is no evidence that supports the theory that mosquito bites can spread coronavirus. So close your eyes and ears and do not believe whatever is being shared. As it is a respiratory virus when you sneeze or cough, the droplet generated via it can spread the disease. So when coughing or sneezing, make sure you cover your mouth with a napkin or tissue or you cough inside your elbow.\u00a0 Next Slide 23 Facts That Will Deflate All the Myths about Coronavirus 7. Lab In Wuhan Created The Outbreak Image credit: Pixabay This news has been doing round for a while now. As the number of cases increased, a rumor started that a Chinese lab near the Wuhan market was working on a secret bioweapon that accidentally got leaked and led to this. However, this ain't true. Next Slide 23 Facts That Will Deflate All the Myths about Coronavirus 8. Hand Dryers Can Effectively Kill The Virus Image credit: WHO Hand dryers are not effective in killing COVID-19. The only use of dryers here is to dry your hands after washing your hands using soap and water or an alcohol-based sanitizer.\u00a0 Next Slide 23 Facts That Will Deflate All the Myths about Coronavirus 9. Do Ultraviolet Disinfection Lamp Help Image credit: WHO It surely won't kill any pandemic but will certainly give you skin irritation. Looking at the present scenario, none of us want to end up with another issue.\u00a0 Next Slide 23 Facts That Will Deflate All the Myths about Coronavirus 10. Yoga Is The Cure Image credit: Pixabay Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath might be right about a lot of things but claiming that Yoga can cure coronavirus is not one of them. It does help you in living a healthy life but curing the virus is not one of its chores. \u00a0 Also Read:\u00a0 Coronavirus: Perform These 14 Yoga Asanas and Stand United with PM Narendra Modi in Fighting This Pandemic Next Slide 23 Facts That Will Deflate All the Myths about Coronavirus 11. Thermal Scanners Image credit: WHO Thermal scanners are obviously effective but only in detecting people with fever. However, if someone is infected and not down with fever, yet the machine cannot detect anything. The reason behind it is that it takes 2-10 days before people who are already infected with the virus start showing symptoms.\u00a0 Next Slide 23 Facts That Will Deflate All the Myths about Coronavirus 12. Bat Soup/Snakes Started The Virus Image credit: Pixabay Remember that video of a Chinese woman consuming bat soup that went viral claiming Covid-19 spreads through bats? Well, it's almost a four-year-old video. It's true that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome was passed on from bats but nothing links bats or snakes to the virus yet.\u00a0 Next Slide 23 Facts That Will Deflate All the Myths about Coronavirus 13. Can Spraying Alcohol Or Chlorine Over Your Body Help Image credit: WHO If the virus has already entered your body, no matter what you do, the damage is already done. Spraying alcohol or chlorine might act harmful if it comes in contact with your eyes or mouth. However, both are great as a disinfectant to clean house surfaces but be aware of the quantity as it is flammable.\u00a0 Next Slide 23 Facts That Will Deflate All the Myths about Coronavirus 14. Using Cow Dung And Cow Urine Can Cure The Virus Image credit: Pixabay While many claim that cow urine can cure many problems coronavirus isn't one of them. Indian politician, Suman Haripriya recently commented that cow dung and urine can cure coronavirus. It's simply not true. Next Slide 23 Facts That Will Deflate All the Myths about Coronavirus 15. Would Vaccination Help? Image credit: WHO No cure or vaccination has been developed for it, yet. Scientists and researchers are still working towards it. Though no vaccination will cure you of coronavirus, a vaccine against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. Next Slide 23 Facts That Will Deflate All the Myths about Coronavirus 16. Ayurveda, homeopathy Or Herbal Medicines Can Assist Image credit: Pixabay AYUSH, a division in the Government of India has released some suggestion that talks about precautionary measures but scientists and researchers still have not said that Ayurveda, homeopathy and any other herbal medicines can treat you with this virus.\u00a0 Next Slide 23 Facts That Will Deflate All the Myths about Coronavirus 17. Pets Can Spread The Disease Image credit: Pixabay WHO has stated that dogs cannot contain or transmit this disease as with the cows and birds are also immune to this disease. Next Slide 23 Facts That Will Deflate All the Myths about Coronavirus 18. Rinsing Your Nose with Saline Image credit: Pixabay There is no evidence supporting this claim. It is true that rinsing your nose with Saline you recover quickly from common cold, but not against the virus.\u00a0 Next Slide 23 Facts That Will Deflate All the Myths about Coronavirus 19. Consuming Garlic and Onion Image credit: WHO Garlic is healthy food and studies claim it has antimicrobial properties that help in building your immunity. But nothing proves that eating garlic or onion can cure this outbreak.\u00a0 Next Slide 23 Facts That Will Deflate All the Myths about Coronavirus 20. Elderly And Children More Prone To The Virus Image credit: Pixabay The virus is not age specific. It can happen to anyone and everyone. However, older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease) are more vulnerable to it.\u00a0 Next Slide 23 Facts That Will Deflate All the Myths about Coronavirus 21. Corona Beer Leads To Coronavirus Image credit: Pixabay Well, this proves the Internet is indeed a funny place. Corona beer cannot infect you.

March 26, 2020 in Health 0 Femi Kusa I wonder if Dr Linus Pauling (1901-94) and Dr Robert Atkins (1903-2003) are not laughing at our folly, wherever they are. Dr Pauling died\u00a0 aged 93, leaving behind life long studies on vitamin c, two Nobel prize awards he shared with no one, a remarkable feat, and a long standing controversy on how many milligrams of vitamin c the average human being should consume in the daily diet. Where his fellow medical researchers and physicians limited daily intake at 60 milligrams, Dr Pauling set the minimum daily dosage at 3,000mg and even always ventured beyond 10,000mg(10g). I said he should be smiling wherever he is today because, from about two weeks ago, Chinese doctors have been saying vitamin c at 20,000 mg daily intake has\u00a0 cured some cases of coronavirus among the elderly in their country. Almost overnight, many health food stores in the United States and in the United Kingdom had no vitamin c to sell. Even in Nigeria, many shelves are empty. Since the news about vitamin c\u00a0 coronavirus cure broke in China, I have been asked by some Nigerians if it is not all a hoax,\u00a0 a sales gimmick. Every time, I refer the enquirers to the life long studies of Dr Linus Pauling\u00a0 on the internet. I also mention the uncompromising efforts of Dr Robert Atkins to promote mega dosage nutrition. He died at the age of 72 Dr Pauling was scorned by his colleagues as a man who caused his followers to waste their resources on vitamin c because, as they said, the body would urinarily excrete vitamin c over 60mg daily, or remove it in loose bowels. Dr Pauling\u00a0 replied the criticisms with three simple words. Time Will Tell. Indeed, time told. For while many of them died in their sixties or seventies, Dr Paulin lived to be 93. And even now that some Chinese doctors say they are containing coronavirus with 20,000mg of vitamin c every day, could time not be still telling? As for Dr Atkins, he may be unfit to lace the shoes of Dr Pauling. He was a mega dosage nutritional\u00a0 orthodox doctor. Long before Dr\u00a0 Udo Erasmus unified the fat theory with his work in the book, Fats that heal and Fats that kill, Dr Atkins had been prescribing up to eight grams (80,000mg) of vitamin c daily for pulmonary diseases and encouraging his patients to minimise carbohydrate intake and go for more fats. He set himself in opposition to the American Medical Association (AMA), which crowded his views out of the media and book publishing industry.\u00a0 Dr Atkins\u00a0 set up his own printing press. I came across his works in the 1980s. He did not believe there were diseases without cures. At that time, the popular medical opinion was that fat caused heart disease, heart attacks and stroke. Dr Atkins said fat was good food. Apparently, the fat\u201d bad-mouthed \u201cat that time, which he prescribed in large quantum, sometimes at three grams daily, 300 percent above permitted daily values, were essential fatty acids (EFAs) which are in vogue today. Today, many doctors do not prescribe more than 5,500 international units of vitamin A on daily basis for fear that an excess may cause liver damage. On a collision course with them, Dr Atkins prescribed between 15,000 and 25,000 iu. It is possible Dr Atkins may have lived longer than 72 had he not slipped on that fateful day on a snow covered street of New York near the Atkins Centre and hit his head badly on the kerb and died. \u00a0 Coronavirus and vitamin c \u00a0 About two weeks ago, some Chinese doctors began to inform the medical world that mega intravenous vitamin c dosages may cure corona virus disease. A doctor from Shanghai whose daughter was among doctors in the region heading for Wuhan, epicentre of coronavirus outbreak in China, said many of them were packing vitamin c in suitcases for personal prophylactic use out there in the \u201cinferno\u201d. There have been an official report that decades of vitamin c clinical trials provided huge evidence that the vitamin may kill viruses.This was probably because it helps produce Hydrogen Peroxide which killed microbes. This doctor told the story of a family . The focus is the matriarch\u00a0 who suffered from diabetes, coronary heart disease, other chronic diseases and\u00a0 began to exhibit symptoms of coronavirus infection. Her daughter had read a lot about the immune boosting, antioxidant and virus killing activities of vitamin c and began to take 20 grams (20, 000mg) of it everyday. She persuaded other\u00a0 members of the family to do likewise. The 70-year-old woman\u00a0 reluctantly joined them, taking only 10,000 mg daily. Just before January 2020, her flu like symptoms\u00a0\u00a0 escalated, and she had to go to hospital.\u00a0 She was in the general ward for 10 days, and taken to the intensive Care unit (ICU) when her symptoms worsened. Three of the family members took turns to visit her everyday. Except the masks and gloves they wore during the visits, they took no other precaution other than their regular daily intake of 20 grams (20,000milligrams) of vitamin c tablets . The patient\u2019s daughter informed the doctors about the official advisory on vitamin c for the medical community and requested that her mother be placed on 20,000 mg\u00a0 intravenous vitamin c everyday. This was in addition to her other daily medication. The doctors agreed. And in about two weeks, her doctors began to think of letting her go home. \u00a0 Lessons from the Chinese report \u00a0 The Chinese report teaches us many lessons. The elderly are more likely than the young to be coronavirus victims Vitamin c protected people, young or old who are likely to be infected by corona virus and, if infected, cure them under high dosage therapy, as treatment of choice or adjunct medicine. There is no disease that cannot be overcome through the creation plan for help established by nature in The Will of God. Accordingly, panic or fear is not the approach to the solution of any problem. For those of us who believe in extra earthly life and events, nothing takes place in the material world that has no architype model in the unseen world. These models are formed and sustained by our thoughts and lifestyles on earth and mature someday for us to harvest. When we plan to develop a killer virus on earth, the thoughts go up, develop prototypes for us which we receive through inspiration and believe we have made a discovery.The architype which manifests on earth when we lower a bridge to it through fear or other play in thoughts. \u00a0 Dr Pauling and vitamin c \u00a0 First, I would\u00a0 like to mention the value of lime juice, grape seed extract and pine grape extract(pycogenol) in this matter. Dr James Lind brought lime juice to medical limelight in 1747. Before then, British sailors often died of illnesses associated with long voyages when their organs bled (sub clinical scurvy) which may later manifest outwardly as bleeding gums. In one episode, about 1,300 out of 2,000 sailors perished in a voyage. Dr Lind\u00a0 discovered that lime juice solved this problem. It was antioxidant and contained vitamin c. Vitamin c would appear to work better when it is used alongside grape seed extract or pycogenol and zinc, according to some studies. Pycogenol or pine bark extract was researched by professor Jack Masquelier in the late 1960s after he read the travel diary of Jacques Cartier dated 1534. Cartier was an explorer. His ship got stuck in ice on St Lawrence\u00a0 river. Scurvy killed 25 of his 110 member crew,\u00a0 50 were close to death and only three of the remainder were relatively healthy. Then, they discovered land. Villagers in Quebec region gave them tea made from\u00a0 the bark and leaves of the pine tree. In about one week, they substantially recovered. Professor Masquelier and other medical researchers found about 40 chemicals in pycogenol (pine bark extract) and grape seed extract, the American preference. Today, pycnogenol is believed to fight allergies, protect veins and capillaries, combat inflammation and edema, revive damaged collagen, check clotting and cholesterol build-ups, scavenge free radicals, improve memory, ADHD and autism among many other health challenges. Our goal is to design a strategy for building immunity to its maximum potential in the prevention or treatment of corona virus disease. GlutathIione, one of the body\u2019s primary antioxidants for this and any job, is the central focus. Vitamin c boosts glutathione production and extends its shelf life. Pycogenol, like grape seed extract, about 50 times more powerful than vitamin c and vitamin E as an antioxidant, revives tired vitamin c and extends its shelf life. Selenium impacts vitamin E and glutathione. Zinc boosts production of immune cells. Italian scientists a few years ago researched the impact of pycnogenol, vitamin c and zinc combination on immune function with startling results. Cellgevity, a\u00a0 cysteine formula, boosts glutathione level. Sulfur rich foods build glutathione. Some of them include garlic, onion, avocados, okra, asparagus, milk thistle, turmeric, curcumin and whey protein. Dr Pauling and vitamin c His studies were as controversial and remarkable. He found that vitamin c may neutralise snake poison, prevent retinal detachment, shorten the course of the cold virus, protect collagen structures, destroy free radicals, calm inflammation and help drainage in the eye, thereby preventing glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness, among many suggestions. In pursuit of an answer to the enquiry.Is mega dosage of\u00a0 vitamin c a conqueror of corona- virus disease ? I yield the ground to Michael Wooldridge. Linus Pauling lectures on Vitamin c and Heart Disease, August 13, 1993 By Michael Wooldridge, [email\u00a0protected] One of the great scientific mavericks of this century spoke at LBL August 10, 1993 at a special seminar hosted by the Life Sciences Division\u2019s Lipoprotein and Atherosclerosis Group. Linus Pauling, two-time Nobel laureate and the world\u2019s foremost vitamin c proponent, entertained an overflow crowd in the Bldg. 66 auditorium with a talk on vitamin c and heart disease. The lively 92-year-old first gave a candid history of how he came to take up the vitamin c cause. He was introduced to the subject by biochemist Irwin Stone in 1966. Five years later, he would pen Vitamin c and the\u00a0 Common cold, and then boldly go on to champion vitamin c\u00a0 as a fighter of more serious diseases such as cancer. According to Pauling, the vitamin\u2019s versatility in illness prevention arises from its role in the manufacture of collagen, the protein that gives shape to connective tissues and strength to skin and blood vessels. One of the great misfortunes of human evolution, Pauling explained, was when our human ancestors lost their ability to manufacture vitamin c. Pauling thinks the trait was probably discarded at a time when our ancestors had a diet of vitamin-rich plants and didn\u2019t need to produce the vitamin themselves. This left today\u2019s primates (including humans) as one of the few groups of animals that must get the vitamin through the diet. Ever since proto-humans moved out of fruit-and-vegetable-rich habitats, Pauling said, they have suffered great deficiencies of vitamin c. Pauling has forthrightly recommended that people make up for this deficiency with daily doses of vitamin c much greater than the 60 mg generally recommended. He said our vitamin c consumption should be at par with what other animals produce by themselves, typically 10-12 grams a day. Pauling practises what he preaches, having gradually upped his daily doses of vitamin c from 3 grams in the 1960s to a hefty 18 grams today. Pauling went on to discuss vitamin c\u2019s connection with lipoprotein-a, a substance whose levels in the blood have been linked to cardiovascular disease. Lipoprotein-a is also a major component of the plaques found in the blood vessels of atherosclerosis patients. Pauling has published studies asserting that lipoprotein-a is a surrogate for vitamin c, serving to strengthen blood vessel walls in the absence of adequate amounts of the vitamin in the diet. In the lecture, Pauling noted that animals which, unlike humans, manufacture their vitamin c and have much higher levels of the vitamin in their bodies, have very little lipoprotein-a in their blood. Pauling is convinced that doses of vitamin c can help prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease, inhibiting the formation of disease-promoting lesions on blood vessel walls and perhaps decreasing the production of lipoprotein-a in the blood. Vitamin c\u2019s link to healthy blood vessels, Pauling said, is further supported by studies of scurvy, the disease caused by vitamin c deficiency. Fifty percent of patients who die of scurvy, he said, do so because of ruptured blood vessels. Pauling won his first Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1954 for using quantum mechanics to elucidate the nature of chemical bonds. He garnered a Nobel Peace Prize in 1962 for his efforts to stem nuclear weapons proliferation. The scientist founded the Linus Pauling Institute in Palo Alto, where research on vitamin c and other nutrients continues today. \u00a0 About Nigeria \u00a0 Linus Pauling\u2019s name remains acidic and alkaline in different circles, acidic among those who believe he was a quack who made the minerals and vitamins markets a gold mine of sorts, and alkaline among people who believe they owe their lives to him. Even when study after study have disproved his contentions, it has turned out that the researchers employed vitamin c at dosages of no more than 3,000mg daily whereas Dr Pauling took about 18,000mg daily. It would have been interesting to have Dr Pauling speak today about vitamin c and coronavirus pandemic. He has left the flesh, no doubt. But the stove would appear to be burning still. Have the Chinese spoken, using 20,000 mg of vitamin c intravenously everyday to clean their virus slate? As for Nigerians, we panic a lot. There was pressure on president Mohammadu Buhari to address the nation. Did the Chinese leader speak to the nation before Chinese doctors quelled corona- virus fire in China? Mr Gbenga Omotosho, Commissioner for Information and Srategy in Lagos State, was right on the mark. This is a season for the experts, he said. President Donald Trump spoke about chloroquine in the United States, and ignited self medication in some countries, compounding problems. People who have submitted their souls to the church staged circus shows. I received video messages that God was punishing the Chinese and Europeans for not believing he exists. I reminded one of them that the Chinese lost no more than 5,000 lives in three months whereas malaria fever and its complications kill about 25,000 Nigerians every month, according to government and World Health Organisation(WHO) figures. One well known church leader said sarcastically in his\u00a0 radio sermon last Sunday that more than 50 people gathered skin to skin in open markets and bus stops, a critique of the bar of church attendance on Sundays. The revered man said, also, the Almighty Creator sent Lucifer to unleash coronavirus to prove to man that He was still God and \u201cin control\u201d. My housekeeper asked me if the creator had any need to do that, and if the statement was not a belittling of Him. I wondered if this gentleman thought the creator and Lucifer worked in tandem, if good and evil, like light and darkness, worked cooperatively. He even said someone asked him why the creator did not forbid Lucifer from tormenting mankind and replied that the creator spared Lucifer to be able to use him to punish humanity whenever the need\u00a0 arose. So, I wondered, did it mean the creator was evil and working with evil when we all know he is light, pure and holy? Obviously, he was a shepherd jiltery about the flock removed from his control which he needed to hold down with yet another falsehood about an event God does not need to know about. He is severally called Jesus his heavenly father. But Jesus never said he was the father of any man. He even taught us to pray.\u201dOur father who art in Heaven\u201d\u2026 He always referred only to his father in heaven and said he was nothing without him. I saw the church as shaken by detachment from the congregation from its suffocating hold. And I wondered why none of the big \u201cmiracles\u201d performing churches have not volunteered prayers- only intervention for coronavirus victims. I saw a shocking video. A Chinese man collapsed in a Lagos street. A fellow Chinese was struggling to get him up. A Lagos crowd gathered around them, accusing the fallen man of bringing coronavirus to Nigeria and cursing.\u201dOloshi, oloriburuku, ibi l\u2019 o ma ku si\u201d, telling him and his country man he would not survive the fall. These men must be Christians or moslems, who believe in the creator, who have heard of the parable of the Good Samaritan. I wish it would be possible for law enforcers to track the video, identify those heartless Nigerians and bring them to book. Finally, something good always comes out of something bad. If the government had not banned foreign rice and forced us to grow Nigerian rice and eat it, irrespective of the stones in it, where would rice have been coming from at this time that works trade is under lock and key? Thank you Dr Linus Pauling. Thank you Chinese doctors for reminding us of vitamin c. Thank you Nigerian doctors for giving our country the lowest death rate worldwide from coronavirus. Our brothers and sisters who fled abroad, believing there is no good in this country should now know that Nigeria is a great country. I love my country.

Alex Kasprak Published 26 March 2020 Image via Getty Images Claim Drinking hot water with lemons will cure or prevent COVID-19; drinking hot water with lemons and sodium bicarbonate will \u201calkalize the immune system\u201d and cure or prevent COVID-19. Rating False About this rating Do you rely on Snopes reporting? Become a member today. Origin As governments fight the COVID-19 pandemic, Snopes is fighting an \u201cinfodemic\u201d of rumors and misinformation, and you can help. Browse our coronavirus fact checks here. Tell us about any questionable or concerning rumors and \u201cadvice\u201d you encounter here. A significant amount of COVID-19 coronavirus disease misinformation spreading across social media or chat apps takes the form of copied-and-pasted \u201cadvice\u201d posts attributed to anonymous \u201cexperts\u201d. These posts are usually riddled with scientific errors and/or promises of cures. Here we look at two such \u201ccure\u201d posts that involve hot water and lemons. The Claims One claim, attributed to a Chinese researcher, implores readers to \u201cuse as much natural vitamin C\u201d as possible and suggests lemons as a good source. To that point, the post claims that regular consumption of a drink made from three lemon slices and hot water helps \u201cagainst the spread of [COVID-19]\u201d and \u201cdestroys the virus.\u201d While vitamin C does play a role in several immune system functions, its use as a treatment to prevent or cure viral infections is unsupported by science. A second, slightly modified claim is attributed to \u201cinformation\u201d that \u201ccomes from Israel\u201d and includes the addition of sodium bicarbonate to the hot lemon water cure. Unlike the previous assertion, which rests largely on claims about vitamin C, this cure allegedly works because it can \u201calkalize the immune system.\u201d The ubiquity of this concoction in Israel, the post additionally claims, is why the country has seen no cases of the disease. This is false. \u201cAlkalizing the immune system\u201d is an illogical pseudoscientific concept, and at this time of this reporting, Israel had over 2,300 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Can Hot Lemon \u2018Kill the Spread of This Virus\u2019? This dubious claim, which now circulates in text form on social media platforms, has its origins in a video shared extensively on Facebook messenger and created by the owner of the YouTube channel \u201cMrHealthyChannel.\u201d Even before any medical information is presented, several red flags are apparent. \u201cHi, I am Jiao Shenme Mingzi from China, Researcher at the School of Medicine Zanjan University,\u201d the post begins. Zanjan University is in Iran, and, as PolitiFact noted, this person\u2019s alleged name closely resembles the phonetic spelling of \u201cjiao shenme mingzi,\u201d which is not a name but a phrase used to ask for someone\u2019s name. The video and posts derived from transcripts of that video falsely assert that the reason we lack a medical cure for COVID-19, and therefore need a natural remedy that contains vitamin C, is a result of the novel coronavirus\u2019 unexpected or rapid genetic mutation (an issue Snopes addressed here). In reality, this virus is dangerous because of its ability, like other infection-causing viruses, to sustain and replicate in human cells, particularly those of the upper respiratory system. Though early work had suggested vitamin C as a treatment for the common cold, which is also a viral upper respiratory infection, later work has cast doubt on that notion. In general, no scientific research has shown an ability for vitamin C supplementation to \u201ckill\u201d any upper-respiratory system virus or to reduce its spread. As summarized by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), \u201cthe evidence to date suggests that regular intakes of vitamin C at doses of at least 200 mg/per day do not reduce the incidence of the common cold in the general population.\u201d For reference, that single lemon cut into three slices and served with hot water contains about 30 milligrams of vitamin c. The NIH does suggest that \u201cvitamin C supplements might shorten the duration of the common cold and ameliorate symptom severity\u201d as well as provide some potential benefit to certain populations of people with compromised immune systems. As Dr. Caroline Apovian, a professor of medicine and pediatrics at the Boston University School of Medicine, explained to USA Today, \u201cThe only impact that vitamins and supplements may have in any cold or flu is to lessen the severity.\u201d\u00a0 As such, the assertion that a single lemon served with hot water will \u201ckill the spread of this virus in our body\u201d is unsupported by science. Can Lemon Help \u2018Alkalize the Immune System\u2019? This iteration of the lemon and hot water cure comes from a viral copy-pasted-and-reshared bit of text on Facebook that usually begins with the false statement that the information comes \u201cfrom Israel where this virus did not cause any deaths.\u201d As previously noted, Israel has in no way been immune to the coronavirus pandemic, nor are they, as the post also asserts, \u201crelaxed about the virus.\u201d On March 25, the Israeli government announced \u2014 like other governments around the world \u2014 measures to limit the movement of its citizens in order to slow the disease\u2019s spread. The alleged science here is just as straightforward to debunk. The ability to \u201calkalize\u201d one\u2019s body was a popular claim promoted by scientists in the 1920s and by supplement peddlers and health gurus today. But unless you suffer from certain specific and medically catastrophic conditions like metabolic acidosis, it is effectively impossible to alter, through diet, the pH of the cellular environment that makes up the various tissues of your body, including those of the immune system. The body maintains these environments in a tightly controlled range: a pH between 7.36 and 7.44 in arteries, and around 7.2 in intracellular spaces. The only pH value in your body that you would be altering with your diet is the pH of your urine. Such a modification would provide no medical benefit to the fight against a viral infection. The Bottom Line Lemon and hot water used as a vitamin C therapy will not \u201ckill\u201d or \u201cslow the spread\u201d of COVID-19, nor would it provide a clinically significant amount of vitamin C to begin with. A buffered solution of hot lemon juice and sodium bicarbonate, similarly, will do nothing to change the pH of either your body or your immune system. For these reasons both lemon-related \u201ccures\u201d are rated \u201cFalse.\u201d Snopes.com Since 1994 Help Supercharge Snopes For 2020 We have big plans. We need your help. Become a member!

Wellness oi-Shivangi Karn By Shivangi Karn on March 28, 2020 Doctors and scientists across the world are in a mad dash to discover an effective vaccine or treatment method for the COVID-19. They are testing several existing antimalarials, antivirals and Unani drugs to see if they can combat the effect of COVID-19. There have been several theories coming out every day claiming to be a cure for coronavirus. However, there has not been any scientific evidence to prove them all. On the other hand, a report based on Dr Andrew G. Weber (New York) says that people are recovering at a faster rate after receiving vitamin C intravenously compared to people who do not receive the dose. The revelation is done based on a study that says vitamin C has beneficial effects on the infections, blood pressure and bronchoconstriction and tend to shorten the stay period of the patient in the ICU. [1] Vitamin C and The Immune System Vitamin C is very essential to humans. It is a powerful antioxidant that contributes to the immune system of our body by supporting multiple cellular functions. Deficiency of this essential nutrient in our body can lead to impaired immunity and symptoms such as rough skin, weakness, anaemia and swollen joints. The main function of vitamin C is to protect against pathogens and promote scavenging activity in the body. Free radicals scavenging is very important to save cells from the damage of free radicals. Vitamin C is also very effective to prevent and treat respiratory infections. [2] Vitamin C is linked to several inflammatory processes and immunity. It helps in the production and function of white blood cells and fights against several inflammatory diseases. Not only this, but vitamin C is also known to have antiviral and antibacterial roles. [3] Drop-In Vitamin C Level A study published in the Journal of The Royal Society of Medicine says that vitamin C increases the functioning of T-cells in our body and decreases the multiplication of viruses. It also increases resistance against multiple viral and bacterial infections like pneumonia. [4] Drop in the levels of vitamin C in our body can lead to acute bronchitis and pneumonia and other lung infections. Therefore, it is essential to maintain a sufficient dosage of vitamin C in the body i.e. 75 mg for adult women and 90 mg for adult men. Another study suggests that pneumonia reduced to around 80% in people who were administered with dietary vitamin C intake. Also, the incidence of common cold decreased by an average of 50%. [5] Coronavirus causes accumulation of fluids in the lungs and destroys the alveolar capillaries. A clinical trial study carried out in February 2020 suggests that vitamin C helps to eliminate alveolar fluid and prevent its further accumulation thus, reducing damage to the lungs. It also helps prevent the common cold and shows protective effects on patients who have influenza. [6] Vitamin C And SARS-CoV According to a Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, vitamin C has reduced the severity and duration of the common cold in humans as well as decreased viral respiratory infections. In three controlled trials, vitamin C has shown its effectiveness in lowering the incidence of pneumonia and respiratory tract infection caused due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). [7] Is It Effective To Cure COVID-19? Vitamin C has a lot of health benefits but saying that it completely helps cure COVID-19 would be wrong. Though several clinical trials say that vitamin C boosts the immune system and help fight against coronavirus, the study needs further evidence to prove it. Till then, the most effective way to prevent the spread of the infection is to maintain good hand hygiene and self-isolation until there's no particular vaccine developed.

Tuberculosis vaccine holds promises in fight against COVID-19 Meanwhile, researchers are testing the efficacy of a tuberculosis vaccine in fight against COVID-19. India is also set to begin trials Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine on high-risk COVID-19 groups, within the next two weeks. The BCG is administered to millions of Indian children soon after birth to protect against tuberculosis. Serum Institute of India (SII) plans to start the trials in Maharashtra, particularly Pune. The trails is said to be conducted on 2,000 to 3,000 \u201chigh-risk\u201d people that include the elderly, people with co-morbid conditions and healthcare workers. The company will test if BCG vaccine can boost immunity against the novel coronavirus. SII CEO Adar Poonawalla told a national daily that if the BCG vaccine proves effective against COVID-19, it will be a far safer alternative as it lacks side effects. BCG vaccine could be a game changer:US scientists A study from the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) has linked BCG vaccination with fewer coronavirus cases. The researchers found that countries that do not have universal policies of BCG vaccination have been more severely affected by COVID-19 pandemic compared to those who do. For example, they cited Italy, the Netherlands, and the United States, don\u2019t administer the BCG vaccine as a part of their vaccination policy and they are among the worst COVID-19 affected countries. The study noted that a combination of reduced morbidity and mortality could make the BCG vaccination a game-changer in the fight against the novel coronavirus. WHO doesn\u2019t recommend BCG vaccine for COVID-19 The World Health organisation has, however, warned that there is no evidence that the BCG vaccine protects people against infection with COVID-19 virus. In the absence of evidence, the organisation said it doesn\u2019t recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19. \u201cThere is experimental evidence from both animal and human studies that the BCG vaccine has non-specific effects on the immune system. These effects have not been well characterized and their clinical relevance is unknown,\u201d WHO said in its website. BCG vaccination prevents severe forms of tuberculosis in children and WHO is worried that diversion of local supplies for COVID-19 may result in \u201cneonates not being vaccinated, resulting in an increase of disease and deaths from tuberculosis.\u201d The organisation recommends neonatal BCG vaccination in countries or settings with a high incidence of tuberculosis. \u00a0 \u00a0 Published : April 22, 2020 4:33 pm | Updated:April 22, 2020 4:39 pm Read Disclaimer Comments - Join the Discussion You will not pass on the COVID-19 virus if you breastfeed your baby: But take precautions Please Wait.

But scientists in several countries are testing a century-old tuberculosis (TB) vaccine to see if it might boost the immune system to reduce respiratory symptoms in people who get new coronavirus infections. Researchers in Australia and Europe are testing whether the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, introduced in the 1920s to fight tuberculosis, might be deployed to combat COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Clinical trials are focused on two groups at high-risk for COVID-19: health care workers and the elderly. Scroll to continue with content Ad Here is what scientists know, and what they are trying to find out: HOW CAN A TB VACCINE HELP WITH OTHER INFECTIONS? The BCG vaccine contains a live but weakened strain of tuberculosis bacteria that provokes the body to develop antibodies to attack TB bacteria. This is called an adaptive immune response, because the body develops a defense against a specific disease-causing microorganism, or pathogen, after encountering it. Most vaccines create an adaptive immune response to a single pathogen. Unlike other vaccines, the BCG vaccine may also boost the innate immune system, first-line defenses that keep a variety of pathogens from entering the body or from establishing an infection. One study in Guinea-Bissau found 50% lower mortality rates in children vaccinated with BCG than in kids who did not get this vaccine. That is a much bigger drop in deaths than could be explained by a reduction in TB cases. Some studies have found similar reductions in respiratory infections among teens and the elderly. WHAT SCIENTISTS DO NOT KNOW Scientists do not have data yet on the effect of BCG vaccination on coronaviruses in general or SARS-CoV-2 in particular. Story continues There are also many BCG vaccines, with different capacities to protect against various TB strains. Scientists need to determine which BCG vaccines might have the best ability to boost the innate immune system to fight COVID-19. WHO SHOULD GET THE BCG VACCINE RIGHT NOW? Scientists say it will take several months to get results from trials testing the BCG vaccine to fight COVID-19. In the meantime, people should not rush to get it because it has not been widely tested in adults and might be harmful. Also, a run on the BCG vaccine to fight COVID-19 might cause shortages for children who need it to prevent TB.

Credit: CNBC photo. According to a US study made widely available by\u00a0MedRXiv, a combination of reduced morbidity and mortality could make the tuberculosis (TB) vaccine \u2014 Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination \u2014 a game-changer in the fight against Covid-19. The findings were published by\u00a0NYIT College of Osteopathic Medicine\u00a0(NYITCOM) researchers, led by\u00a0Gonzalo Otazu, Ph.D., assistant professor of biomedical sciences, according to a report by Kim Tucker Campo at the New York Institute of Technology. \u00a0 The United States currently leads the world in confirmed Covid-19 cases, followed by Italy, per the latest report from Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE), the report said. Now NYITCOM researchers propose that the severity of Covid-19 impact may be linked to varying national policies on BCG childhood vaccination, the report said. \u201cWe found that countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination, such as Italy, the Netherlands, and the United States have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies,\u201d the researchers state. As one of the most widely used vaccines in the world, the BCG vaccine has existed for nearly a century and has been shown to be an effective tool in preventing meningitis and disseminated TB in children, the report said. The inoculation is also believed to offer broad-ranging protection against respiratory infections, which present similar symptoms to Covid-19. In fact, Australian researchers have just announced plans to fast track large-scale testing to see if the BCG vaccination can protect health workers from the coronavirus, the report said. Otazu, who is also a researcher in the new\u00a0Center for Biomedical Innovation, completed the study with the assistance of NYITCOM students\u00a0Aaron Miller,\u00a0Mac Josh Reandelar,\u00a0Kimberly Fasciglione, and\u00a0Violeta Roumenova, along with Center technician\u00a0Yan Li. The team compared various nations\u2019 BCG vaccination policies with their Covid-19 morbidity and mortality and found a significant positive correlation between the year when universal BCG vaccination policies were adopted and the country\u2019s mortality rate, the report said. In other words, the earlier a policy was established, the more likely that a significant portion of the population, especially the elderly, would be protected. For example Iran, which has a current universal BCG vaccination policy that only started in 1984, has an elevated mortality rate with 19.7 deaths per million inhabitants, the report said. In contrast, Japan, which started its universal BCG policy in 1947, has approximately 100 times fewer deaths per million people, with 0.28 deaths, the report said. Furthermore, Brazil started universal vaccination in 1920 and has an even lower mortality rate of 0.0573 deaths per million inhabitants. So why do some nations vaccinate while others do not? As TB cases fell in the late 20th century, several higher-income countries in Europe dropped their universal BCG policies between 1963 and 2010, the report said. In the US, the CDC currently recommends the BCG vaccine only for very select persons who meet specific criteria and in consultation with a TB expert, the report said. Among the 180 countries with BCG data available today, 157 countries currently recommend universal BCG vaccination. The remaining 23 countries have either stopped BCG vaccination due to a reduction in TB incidence or have traditionally favored selective vaccination of \u201cat-risk\u201d groups.

Download PDF Copy By Dr. Liji Thomas, MDApr 26 2020 A new paper published on the preprint server medRxiv in April 2020 challenges the hypothesis that BCG vaccination confers some degree of protection against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the pneumonic illness COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic is still actively spreading across communities all over the world, in over 210 countries and territories. The total number of infections has crossed 2.9 million, with almost 206,000 deaths so far. The most significant case fatalities have been in the USA, Spain, Italy, France, and the UK, but the rates are increasing in many parts of the world. Study: Is there evidence that BCG vaccination has non-specific protective effects for COVID 19 infections or is it an illusion created by lack of testing?. Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia. Doctor vaccinating BCG at school. Image Credit: Yusnizam Yusof / Shutterstock Heterogeneous spread Even though the pandemic began in China, its spread has been significantly uneven. After affecting a few Asian countries, mainly South Korea and Japan, it skipped continents to plague Europe and North America over the next six weeks. The rates at which infections have grown in various parts of the world are also quite different. Researchers have been making desperate efforts to understand how the virus spreads and causes illness. A diverse spectrum of disease models has also emerged to attempt to predict the future burden of disease and the healthcare systems that will be necessary to care for the affected. However, the heterogeneous nature of the spread of COVID-19 is still largely unexplained, though several studies have evoked climatic differences to account for the perceived variations in the incidence, spread, and mortality rate of the disease. Could the BCG vaccine play a role? One such stream of research concerns the possible preventive role of the BCG (Bacille Calmette Gu\u00e9rin) vaccine. Since this vaccine is administered at widely different rates in different continents, and because its mechanism of action may involve non-specific boosting of immunity, some scientists postulated that it could have imparted greater immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in countries where it is widely used. The present study aims to examine the impact of BCG vaccination on the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 using the most recent data and after controlling for the number of tests per million population, or the effect of testing on the number of cases per million or deaths per million population. This is a vital omission since these variables depend on testing for detection. How does testing affect case prevalence rates? When the frequency of testing is very different between countries with similar infection rates or prevalence, and similar mortality rates, the result will be that they show a widely disparate number of cases and deaths per million. This is not because of a truly low prevalence or incidence or mortality, but because of the low testing rate in one country resulting in a low case detection rate. Related Stories Coronavirus able to survive near boiling point of water, study shows Missing COVID-19 antibodies suggest mystery immune response Coronavirus has mutated into at least 30 strains It is known that low-income countries like Afghanistan have an abysmal testing rate of 13 per million population, while Iceland has over 100,000 tests per million (April 10, 2020, data). It is also clear that the number of cases and deaths per million is typically higher in those countries that are testing at much higher rates. Analyzing the BCG effect The current study seeks to extend research in this area in several ways. For one, the researchers use a new variable called the BCG Index rather than BCG itself. This is the proportion of a population that has received the BCG vaccine. Secondly, they used additional controls to adjust for potential confounders such as the HDI scores, the period since the country had 1 case per million, the population density, the above-65 segment as a percentage of the population, the percentage of the population in urban areas and the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) that reflects the transparency of the government. The third difference was in using tests per million and cases per test as dependent variables. Finally, they verified the findings from the analysis of earlier studies using the most recent data The researchers created multiple regression models, controlled for confounding demographic and economic factors, and for the period of reported spread. For instance, the time elapsed since a country reported its first 100 confirmed cases. The BCG variable was in 3 tiers, comprising those who have never had scheduled BCG vaccination, those who have had it in the past but currently don\u2019t have it. Those whose immunization schedules currently include it. The BCG Index is also included in the analysis, namely, the number of years since the BCG was made part of the immunization schedule in a country. The Index was created to improve the reliability of the data on BCG coverage in a population compared to a cross-sectional or snapshot study of the BCG inclusion in the immunization program. The researchers then analyzed how the vaccine changed the rates of infection and death due to COVID-19 in that country, and particularly in how this effect endures when testing is controlled for, that is, by considering the number of tests per million population. They also looked at the cases per test (total number of cases per million divided by the number of tests per million). What did the study show? Like earlier studies, this time around too, the researchers found a link between the presence of routine BCG vaccination and fewer cases as well as deaths per million. However, when the number of tests per million is accounted for, there is no longer any effect of BCG vaccination in reducing either the number of cases or deaths per million. Thus, factors like testing may have an impact on the routine administration of BCG and the caseload or mortality rate due to COVID-19 in a country. Why is the study important? The false security engendered by the impression that BCG coverage protects a population against COVID-19 could lead to poor policy decisions and bad judgment on the part of policymakers and healthcare workers alike. Universal BCG coverage is most likely in low-income countries, and these are the countries where reducing efforts to deal with COVID-19 by scaling up testing and recommending social distancing could be disastrous. The researchers are currently setting up a dataset that will help measure the impact of the BCG vaccine over time rather than as a single snapshot.

From \u2018miracle minerals\u2019 to herbal remedies and supplements, it seems the wellness industry will stop at nothing to capitalise on the worst public health crisis in a generation. \u00a0Homeopaths have claimed they have a cure. Aromatherapists are selling \u2018anti-viral essential oils\u2019. Chiropractors claim spinal treatment can \u2018boost the immune system\u2019 and natropaths have recommended eating garlic to prevent an infection. None of these claims are true. There is no cure for Covid-19, and scientists across the world are racing against the clock to develop a vaccine for it. Yet with people desperately rushing to supermarkets to get their hands on anything that can reduce their risk of infection, many are falling for this false health advice. Amid rising panic over coronavirus, many people are falling for false claims about how to avoid an infection (Picture: PA) Here are some of the top coronavirus wellness scams to look out for \u2013 and why they won\u2019t work\u2026 Advertisement Advertisement Eating garlic can get rid of coronavirus During the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak a post on social media, shared by hundreds of thousands of people, claimed drinking boiled garlic water would \u2018improve and cure\u2019 people afflicted with the virus overnight. Several naturopaths have claimed eating garlic, along with other \u2018immune boosting\u2019 food such as ginger and veg, can also prevent catching Covid-19. Throughout history many cultures have hailed garlic for its alleged ability to treat and prevent various illnesses, including colds and flu. However, scientific evidence supporting such claims are weak. The World Health Organisation (WHO) even addressed this rumour in their myth busting guide to Covid-19. Several posts on social media have claimed garlic can cure coronavirus (Picture: Getty) The World Health Organisation has debunked an ancient myth that garlic can cure virus\u2019 (Picture: WHO) WHO said: \u2018Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.\u2019 The NHS says eating fruit and veg and drinking plenty of water will, in general, keep you healthy. But there is no evidence specific foods will help fight this particular virus. Herbal remedies and supplements will boost your immune system On that note, it\u2019s worth pointing out that the whole concept of \u2018boosting your immune system\u2019, whether by eating superfoods, doing a juice cleanse or taking herbal remedies and supplements, is scientifically suspect. Scientists say there is little evidence supporting claims vitamins and supplements can boost the immune system (Picture: Getty) Charles Bangham, \u00a0professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Imperial College London, has previously warned against the idea that the \u2018immune system is some kind of internal force field that can be boosted or patched up\u2019. In an interview for The Guardian way before anyone had ever heard of Covid-19 he said: \u2018This couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. As the name suggests it\u2019s not a single thing but a system incorporating many organs and biological functions.\u2019 Advertisement Advertisement Of course, this has never stopped Instagram influencers and alternative medical practitioners claiming conveniently expensive products can do exactly that. Even at the best of times, immune- boosting is a popular marketing trend, never mind during a global pandemic. wellness grifters are ON IT pic.twitter.com/CiWfIEPA18\u2014 Sarah Johnson (@sarahcjohnson) March 13, 2020 The Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) has said it is taking swift action after a number of homeopaths in the UK claimed they had remedies to cure Covid-19 (again, there is no cure for the virus). A Telegraph investigation found these remedies include colloidal silver to \u2018boost the immune system\u2019, the side effects of which include turning the skin a bluish grey colour, which\u00a0can be permanent, and kidney damage. In the US, the Food and drug administration (FDA) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are pursuing legal action against seven companies for selling unapproved herbal remedies and other supplements to \u2018treat or cure the novel coronavirus\u2019. One of those companies has ran out of \u2018anti-viral herbals\u2019 due to \u2018overwhelming demand\u2019, but advises people to google immune herbs as they are being sold \u2018across the nation\u2019. US and UK advertising authorities have clamped down on homeopaths claiming supplements and remedies can cure coronavirus (Picture: Rouzes) Homeopathy is hugely popular in the states and proponents may genuinely think they notice health benefits when they take special remedies. But, according to\u00a0Dr Ben Neuman, the head of the biology department at Texas A&M University-Texarkana, this is down to the \u2018placebo effect\u2019 \u2013 when your brain tricks you into thinking that this works. Advertisement Addressing claims about supplements, Medicine researcher Dr Melanie R Graber from the University of Connecticut has explained: \u2018Unless you have a vitamin deficiency, it is believed that supplements aren\u2019t really necessary. Focus on eating a diet full of various fruits and vegetables to meet your vitamin and mineral needs.\u2019 This is inline with NHS advice, which says there is \u2018no good-quality evidence that homeopathy works as a treatment for any health condition\u2019 and that most people don\u2019t need to take vitamin supplements if they already have a balanced diet. Drinkable Silver Another myth gaining popularity amid the coronvirus pandemic is that colloidal silver \u2013 tiny particles of the metal suspended into liquid \u2013 can cure the disease. This false claim was brought to the attention of US authorities after it was promoted on televangelist Jim Bakker\u2019s show. TV evangelist Jim Bakker is facing legal action for selling silver solution he claims can cure coronavirus A guest said it hadn\u2019t been tested on Covid-19, but claimed the liquid solution had been tested on other strains of coronavirus, \u2018and has been able to eliminate it within 12 hours\u2019. Not only does silver \u2018totally eliminate\u2019 the virus, the so-called natural health expert claimed, but does it, also \u2018kill it, deactivate it and then boost your immune system\u2019. Bakker is now being sued by the State of Missouri for refusing to take the produce off his website, insisting the treatment does work. His belief has been widely shared on Facebook, particularly by \u2018medical freedom\u2019 groups which are extremely suspicious of mainstream medical advice. Advertisement DIY hand sanitiser Due to a global hand sanitiser shortage sparked by panic buying, many are taking it upon themselves to promote their own recipes online. While this may be well-meaning, it can harm your skin if made wrong. The World Health Organisation has published a guide on how to make a safe and legitimate hand sanitiser. But some experts say soap and hot water is a better option than doing it yourself as it is not an easy process. There is a global shortage of hand sanitiser (Picture: Getty) Hand sanitiser is being sold at inflated prices (Picture: PA) A shortage of hand sanitiser has led to a rise in DIY recipes but experts say soap and water would be more effective (Picture: AFP) Hand gels usually contain emollients, which make them gentler on skin, on top of their 60-70% alcohol content. That\u2019s stronger than anything you would find in a store \u2013 even vodka only has 40% alcohol (and we don\u2019t recommend using that!) Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. said there is no real need to make your own hand sanitiser \u2018as soap and water works just fine\u2019. Here is a guide on how to wash your hands properly, as advised by the NHS. Drinking water to \u2018flush out\u2019 the virus The NHS advise drinking six to eight glasses of water a day as part of a healthy diet. But some on social media have taken it upon themselves to proclaim it has the power to heal when consumed in excess amounts (spoiler: it doesn\u2019t). One post that appeared on multiple Facebook accounts quotes a \u2018Japanese doctor\u2019 who recommends drinking water every 15 minutes to flush out any virus that might have entered the mouth. Meanwhile, there is a version in Arabic that has been shared more than 250,000 times. There is currently no cure for covid-19 and scientists are working round the clock to develop a vaccine (Picture: AFP) Claims that drinking water can flush out coronavirus are catergorically untrue (Picture: REUTERS) University of Oxford Professor Trudie Lang says there is \u2018no biological mechanism\u2019 that would support the idea that you can just wash a respiratory virus down into your stomach and kill it. Meanwhile, Dr Neuman, called it \u2018bonkers\u2019, explaining that once the virus enters your body it will quickly infect your cells and, over time, spread to your lungs. Although in some cases it does reach the intestines, gulping down water won\u2019t have any effect as \u2018the intestines actually have more of the virus receptor than the lungs, and would offer a potential route of access to the bloodstream\u2019. Essential oils I think we\u2019ve established by now that there is no cure for Covid-19. Needless to say, \u2018anti-viral oils\u2019 will not help you fight off symptoms of the pneumonia-like flu. US beauty influencer Michelle Phan has come under fire for making such a claim on her Instagram account to over two million followers. Posting a picture of her essential-oil diffuser she wrote: \u2018If you are burning antiviral essential oils around you this will kill off the virus before it enters your system.\u2019 Aromatherpists have faced a crack down for suggesting oils can cure coronavirus (Picture: Tetra images) Dr Pimple Popper (r) called out beauty influencer Michelle Phan (L)(Pictures: Getty) She was forced to apologise when Dr Sandra Lee \u2013 known more commonly as Dr Pimple Popper \u2013 shut down her claim, writing \u2018Sorry, antiviral essential oils DON\u2019T EXIST.\u2019 Aromatherapists would disagree \u2013 and several have written articles on the \u2018best antiviral oils to ward off the novel coronavirus\u2019, promoting ingredients such as cinnamon bark, lemon and clove bud. We asked a couple of experts who both agreed with Dr Pimple Popper that oils can\u2019t fight viruses. That being said, they\u2019re not completely useless for alleviating some symptoms of a common cold. Sorry, antiviral essential oils DON\u00e2\u0080\u0099T EXIST @MichellePhan \u00f0\u009f\u0099\u0088\u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00ac. ", "label": 1, "Q0": "Q0", "c_score": "0.37104881175"}

Tunisia has reported 20 COVID-19 cases since March 2. While no deaths have been reported, authorities have taken tough measures to halt the spread of the disease and fewer customers are crowding the paved alleys of the capital's ancient medina. But in the heart of the old city, Tunisians continue flocking to the Souk el-Blat and its herbalist stalls, where flasks, powders and dried herbs are stacked high. Local and imported herbal medicines are traditionally valued for warding off winter flu, which shares some symptoms with the new coronavirus -- a respiratory infection that has killed more than 6,000 people worldwide. Fear of contagion has seen a rush on garlic, sending the price soaring to 25 dinars (eight Euros) a kilo, while other customers look for plant remedies that are effective and affordable. \"I can understand people falling back on tradition,\" said Hedi Oueslati, a pharmacologist and Tunisia's director general of health. \"But there is currently no medicine nor miracle plant effective against the new coronavirus. \" He continued: \"If we're talking about a grandma's remedy that is not dangerous and poses no problems, ok.\" But, he added, \"you have to be careful not to fall for quackery.\" Some people were profiting from public anxiety to sell \"concoctions\" with unknown ingredients, he warned. - 'Ancestral remedies' - \"What can I take for coronavirus?\" Hanen Oueslati (no relation to the health director) asked a vendor at a stall selling fresh rosemary and oregano. \"I want plants to sterilise the home and others for making herbal infusions,\" said the 38-year-old woman. \"The goal is to protect us, that's all, especially since there is no medication against the virus,\" she said. Fethi Ben Moussa, a 61-year-old herbalist, explained: \"Tunisians love everything traditional and natural: in times of panic they trust in the remedies of our ancestors. \"People are asking for things to prepare at home like thyme, ginger and moringa,\" he said, claiming that they were \"good for immunity and fighting viruses.\" At another shop, Haj Mohamed offered preparations of ginger, jujube honey and tumeric that he claimed, without evidence, are \"100 per cent effective against viruses.\"A second generation herbalist, he claimed these are \"magic ingredients for fighting all kinds of flu\". But Dr Chokri Hamouda, the director general of healthcare in Tunisia, has a warning: \"Just because it's natural doesn't mean it's not harmful.\" Facebook Twitter Google + Share on Whatsapp Related Topics Immunity Cure Medina Tunis Price Tunisia March Women All From Love Coronavirus Recent Stories Currency Rate In Pakistan - Dollar, Euro, Pound, R .. 31 minutes ago 12 new COVID-19 cases in UAE: Ministry of Health a .. 9 hours ago Three more recoveries from coronavirus in UAE 9 hours ago UAE Football Association suspends footballing acti .. 11 hours ago Mohammed bin Rashid, Mohamed bin Zayed discuss nat .. 12 hours ago Ministry of Education certifies over 22,000 teache .. 13 hours ago Your Thoughts and Comments More Stories From Miscellaneous Hong Kong stocks end morning with losses 6 minutes ago Coronavirus spreads to all Canadian provinces 6 minutes ago China logs more coronavirus cases imported from abroad 6 minutes ago Biden, Sanders attack Trump at debate under shadow of virus 6 minutes ago Biden says would 'call out the military, now' to fight virus 6 minutes ago Japan's Honda scores in Botafogo debut 6 minutes ago US airlines slash flights over virus crisis 6 minutes ago Tourism giant TUI suspends most operations on virus fears 15 minutes ago MGM Vegas casinos to shutter due to virus: chairman 16 minutes ago Europeans leave Morocco on special flights as regular air links halted 16 minutes ago Hong Kong stocks start day on back foot 16 minutes ago Oil prices extend losses on price war, virus fallout 16 minutes ago About Us | Contact Us | Advertisment ABOUT US Contact Us \u00a0 Disclaimer \u00a0 Privacy Policy \u00a0 Advertisment \u00a0 Our Network PakistanPoint \u00a0 Emarkaz \u00a0 Hulchul \u00a0 Dictionary \u00a0 Who We Are About Us \u00a0 Contact Us \u00a0 Send Your Content \u00a0 RSS Feed \u00a0 News Widget \u00a0 Site Links: Education - Urdu News - Car Prices - Breaking News - English News - Live Tv Channels - Urdu Horoscope - Horoscope in Urdu - Muslim Names in Urdu - Urdu Poetry - Love Poetry - Sad Poetry - Prize Bond - Mobile Prices in Pakistan - PTV Sports - English to Urdu - Big Ticket - Translate English to Urdu - Ramadan Calendar - Prayer Times - DDF Raffle - Islamic Calendar - Events - Today Islamic Date - Travel - UAE Raffles - Travel Guide - Arabic - Urdu Cooking Recipes - Directory - Pakistan Results - Past Papers - BISE - Schools in Pakistan - Academies & Tuition Centers UrduPoint Network is the largest independent digital media house from Pakistan, catering the needs of its users since year 1997.

Nigerians have been warned to not further harm themselves in the bid to prevent coronavirus infection [Reuters] REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has warned Nigerians against using unverified and unorthodox means to attempt to prevent or cure coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. With a cure for the virus yet to be found, many people across the world have been resorting to self-help in a bid to prevent infection. For weeks since the disease has ravaged the world, authorities have had to battle against fake news about purported prevention tips peddled by different sources from all corners of the world. In a tweet posted on Tuesday, March 31, 2020, the NCDC rubbished some of these tips, warning Nigerians to not cause further harm to themselves in the process. The agency said preventive measures such as drinking palm oil, drinking hot lemon, eating garlic and ginger, gargling warm water and salt, or using special oils are all useless against the disease. The NCDC noted that spraying of water or Dettol, an antiseptic and disinfectant, all over the body also does not prevent or cure the virus. Nigeria has recorded a total of 131 confirmed cases, as of March 30, in 12 states across the country. Eight people have recovered and two have died.

There are text messages and videos of cures for coronavirus. Many people forward them and some even follow the \u201cmethods\u201d with a firm belief that they would be protected from the pandemic. One message even claimed that standing under the sun for a couple of hours could kill the virus. And, a latest video being forwarded on social media platforms has a man sharing the cure for coronavirus, which apparently China had followed and eventually combated the deadly virus. The cure he explained was inhaling hot water with herbs such as tulasi and drinking hot milk with herbs four times a day. He stated that this really worked and saved lives. However, allopathic doctors who saw the video called it \u201cPseudoscience\u201d. Dr Jayakumar, who works at Government Stanley Hospital, said, \u201cTaking milk will improve immunity, but will not clear the virus.\u201d Dr Prashant, who works with a private hospital, said, \u201cThe video talks about steam inhalation, which helps in general all respiratory conditions in early stages, but not specifically coronavirus. When a person is sick with Coronavirus, this may not be enough. This video makes Covid-19 sound like a usual flu, which it is not. People who get sick moderately or severely need hospitalisation and they would not be able to do steam inhalation because lungs would get so bad by then. People need not panic, but should not take Covid-19 lightly. People took it lightly in Italy and we know what happened.\u201d Dr Ravindranath, secretary of Doctors Association for Social Equality said, \u201cThis video is a combination of science and pseudoscience. Inhalation and drinking milk help, but only to some extent.\u201d However, the video was supported by naturopathy practitioners saying it was a good way of improving immunity and preventing the virus. Dr Deepa of Government Yoga and Naturopathy Medical College and hospital, Anna Nagar said, \u201cWe have been giving similar advice to those who are in home quarantine. It can prevent the infection as the virus stays in the throat for five days.\u201d The doctor said they are advising people to have herbal drinks in the morning and evening for immunity boost. \u201cIn the morning, one can take a concoction of 50 ml portions of amla juice, Tulasi juice, ginger juice, 10 ml of lemon juice and quarter spoon of turmeric in a glass of water. This should be taken in empty stomach. In the evening, five grams of Adhimathuram, quarter spoon of turmeric and pepper, 50 ml of ginger juice and Tulasi juice can be boiled and taken. Gargling with salt and hot water also helps.\u201d Both the remedies, she says, help in prevention of coronavirus. Facial steam, she says, helps a lot. \u201cAdd turmeric to the water or Tulasi leaves, and a few drops of eucalyptus oil\u201d, she says. As part of Ayush, Indian System of Medicine, they have been counselling quaratined patients. They help in stress management by telling them about breathing excercises and immunity boosting drinks by sending videos about it. \u00a0 Facebook Twitter Pinterest Linkedin Email WhatsApp Facebook Twitter Pinterest Linkedin Email WhatsApp CHENNAI, TOP STORIES chennai, coroanvirus milk improves immunity, coronavirus allopathic doctors, coronavirus cure, coronavirus cure pseudoscience, coronavirus whatsapp videos, doctors divided over viral WhatsApp video curing coronavirus, dr deepa of government yoga and naturopathy medical college and hospital coronavirus cure, dr jayakumar government stanley hospital coronavirus, dr rvindranath, news website, newstoday, newstodaynet, newstodaynet online, secretary of doctors association for social equality coronavirus cure Naomi N More Posts Post navigation Tamilnadu prisoners make safety masks Stalin gives masks, sanitisers to workers at Kolathur Search for: \u00a0 POINT BLANK Archives \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Latest Posts 102 fresh cases make TN No.1 Corona-hit State in India, total 411 Modi discusses COVID-19 with top sportspersons TN takes tough measures to curb corona Moratorium: Relief or pain?

Narrating her ordeal, the health worker, whose name was only given as Akua, recounted how she contracted the virus unknowingly after having contacts with some patients at her facility who later were diagnosed as COVID 19 patients. According to the 38-year-old mother of two, she started showing symptoms of the disease and isolated herself from her husband and two children aged 8 and 4. As an asthmatic patient, Akua indicated she sensed how dangerous it was to contract the virus and therefore made much efforts to be free from it. Speaking in a telephone interview on Peace FM's 'Kokrokoo' program Friday, April 10, 2020, she revealed how she resorted to the use of concoction produced by herself. \"I soaked garlic, ginger and grains of selim in water for 24hrs and I started taking it. Apart from the taking of the concoction orally, I also used another traditional healing method where for 20 minutes each morning, I sat by a bucket full of hot water and covered myself with a blanket so as for the body to absorb all the heat from the hot water\", she told host, Kwame Sefa Kayi as monitored by Ghanaguardian.com. According to the US-based nurse, her husband and their two children who also showed symptoms and later tested positive, equally relied on the same methods to get healed. She recounted how scared she was to have been diagnosed with COVID-19 but now happy she and her family are free from the virus that has taken many lives.

Sometimes, choosing the most interesting questions to highlight is the best part of my job. This week, I received questions about the new iPhone, keeping gadgets clean, detecting viruses, and more. Do you have a question you\u2019d like to ask me? Tap or click here to email me directly. I personally read every note. COVID conspiracies Q: I read on Facebook that 5G antennas spread the coronavirus. This is frightening! A: This would\u00a0be terrifying \u2014 if there were an ounce of truth to it. The good news is that 5G antennas do not cause coronavirus. Scientists have found no connection between the two phenomena so you can breathe a sigh of relief. The bad news is that this conspiracy theory spread to millions of people, including several celebrities with large social media followings, resulting in the arson of several 5G antennas. I don\u2019t blame people for jumping to conclusions; after all, these are very unusual times, and conspiracy theorists can be very persuasive. But I am deeply troubled to hear that this idea, which has no scientific basis whatsoever, has led to real-world arson. If you notice someone spreading this rumor, please encourage them to stop. It will only make things worse. Tap or click here to get the facts about the 5G coronavirus connection. Sanitize your phone Q: What is the safest best way to clean a smartphone? I read it has more germs than a toilet seat! Gross! A: Smartphones are magnets for bacteria, even under the best circumstances. Regular cleaning can radically reduce your chances of getting sick. You can use a range of antiseptic wipes, but a more high-tech approach is an ultraviolet phone cleaner. This device is specifically designed to disinfect your phone and depending on the model you buy, it may be able to charge your battery as well. UV rays may sound a little theoretical, but they are some of the most effective weapons against accumulated germs on the surface of your device. The CDC has approved this method, and many users have turned to UV technology since the pandemic took hold. \u00a0 Tap or click here for UV phone cleaners that work. iPhone SE details Q: Is Apple\u2019s new $399 iPhone worth the money? How can this one be so cheap compared to the $1,000+ models? A: Millions of people rushed to buy the iPhone X, but millions of others balked at its astronomical price tag. The Apple SE caters to those budget-conscious customers who want exceptional technology but aren\u2019t willing to shell out the big bucks. So, is it worth it? \u00a0 The SE is a pretty great deal. It has a fantastic processor, a professional camera with portrait mode, and a Retina display. The phone is smaller than its predecessors, and you don\u2019t get certain features, such as face recognition or night mode for the camera. But if you have been thinking of upgrading anyway, it\u2019s a steal compared to other Apple products, which can often cost as much as a new MacBook. Tap or click here to see more iPhone SE specs. WFH job market Q: I need to find a job. I searched online, and all I found were scams. A: There\u2019s a special place in hell for scammers who take advantage of a pandemic to trick people out of their money. But they\u2019re still out there, using all the confusion and unemployment to rope you into pyramid schemes and shifty get-rich-quick schemes. At the same time, there are real, legitimate companies that are actively searching for workers \u2014 specifically people who can work from home. If you read this column regularly, you may be excited to know that many of these employers are tech companies. You\u2019ll find educational and healthcare opportunities as well. You may be seeking a temporary position to help you weather a lay-off, but many of these roles could lead to a whole new career path. Tap or click here for a list of 40 companies hiring WFH workers right now. Free virus scans Q: My computer is running slowly. How can I check to see if it has malware or a virus? A: The worst malware is the kind you don\u2019t even realize is infecting your computer. Unfortunately, malware is often designed to evade notice, and the only symptoms are \u2014 as you say \u2014 slower operations or other unusual behavior. How can you be sure that there\u2019s an infection, and how much will it cost to find out? You can still purchase exceptional software, such as Norton AntiVirus, which has led the market for decades. But you can also find highly effective virus scans for free. Meanwhile, don\u2019t assume that a Mac is immune to viruses. Apple does do a great job of protecting its software, but there\u2019s plenty of malware designed to worm its way into your hard drive. A free virus scan is worth a few extra minutes.

Political theories aside, one of the latest ideas to pop up over the Internet and social media is how 5G networks are to blame for the spread or even the cause of the COVID-19 coronavirus. Twitter is now banning posts related to such conspiracy theories and misleading content if they encourage people to do acts of violence or vandalism. More tech-informed people might laugh at the insinuation of 5G\u2019s role in the current pandemic but human history has been full of such lines of thinking. It wasn\u2019t too long ago when cellphones were blamed for causing cancer, giving rise to a short-lived market of anti-radiation stickers for phones. When fear and uncertainty coincides with any new technology or invention, you can be sure that there will be people who will connect the two as cause and effect. It would be laughable if not for the actual dangers they lead to. In the UK, for example, people have been lead not only to believe in such conspiracy theories but to also act on them, setting fires to 5G towers or vandalizing property. And, as always, these messages are being spread like fire over social media. Twitter is now taking action, citing its policies on safety and content. It is formally banning tweets that incite people into harmful activity that lead to damage, destruction, or vandalism of property, especially 5G equipment. To be clear, 5G is specifically mentioned but the policy also covers any unverified claim that could lead to widespread panic or large-scale disorder.

Photograph: Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters At least 20 mobile phone masts across the UK are believed to have been torched or otherwise vandalised since Thursday, according to government and industry sources who are increasingly concerned about the impact of baseless theories linking coronavirus to\u00a05G\u00a0networks. There have been noticeable clusters of attacks on masts around Liverpool and the West Midlands. Owing to the slow rollout of 5G in the UK, many of the masts that have been vandalised did not contain the technology and the attacks merely damaged 3G and 4G equipment. Watch: 5G network towers burnt down in UK, suspected of causing covid-19 deaths New Nigeria Disease Mysteriously Kills 15 people in 48 hours Watch Video: Slay Queen KISSES Macheso, Leaves The Internet In Stitches There is hope that the rate of attacks may now be slowing. Network operators are particularly concerned about the safety of their staff, as members of the public have\u00a0confronted telecoms engineers\u00a0maintaining critical infrastructure, sometimes filming the encounters to share on social media. Mobile operators and home broadband providers estimate there have been at least 30 such incidents in the last week. Engineers for O2 have been issued with signs to display in their vans while working. The signs, which read \u201cKey worker, keeping your network running\u201d, are intended to spread the message that communications workers are playing a crucial role during the current crisis.Advertisement Social networks will\u00a0meet\u00a0the government\u00a0in the coming days to explain what they can do to stop the spread of baseless claims about 5G, although there is a limited amount that can be done to stop videos and messages spreading on messaging services such as WhatsApp. Despite repeated assurances from international radiation watchdogs that 5G is safe, baseless theories about its purported risks have long bubbled away at the fringes of the internet \u2013 in common with previous generations of the telecoms technology. However, the rapid explosion over the last week of claims linking the new telephone standard to the pandemic \u2013 fanned by some celebrities and influencers \u2013 has caught the industry and the government off guard. While many long-running Facebook groups have opposed the rollout of 5G technology, in the last week the social network has had to delete multiple pages encouraging vandalism of the phone network. The number of attacks rose rapidly following a suspected arson attack on a mast in Birmingham on Thursday night. Vodafone confirmed that six sites were targeted over the weekend, and other networks suggested they had seen similar numbers. Share this: Tweet WhatsApp Email Print Like this: Like Loading... Share.

According to the theory, powerful new 5G networks are weakening the human immune system and making people vulnerable to the coronavirus. Harrelson released a report earlier this week on the \"negative effects of 5G,quot; and the possible role it has played in the pandemic. \"John Cusack, the actor, called me bubbah and then blocked me because I gently disagreed with his 5G conspiracy theory,quot; apparently it is a true sentence that I can say in 2020. pic.twitter.com/nGq15ugIN5 \u2013 Oz Bernie Animation Squad \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 (@ JezButt91) April 8, 2020 \"I haven't fully investigated it, I find it very interesting,\" Harrelson wrote in a now-deleted Instagram post, adding that \"5G radiation,quot; is \"exacerbating,quot; the spread of COVID-19 and making it more deadly.

Apparently, the 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory claims that 5G networks started in Wuhan, China at the same time as the COVID-19 pandemic was born. Some conspiracy theorists claim that the radiation from the new 5G networks is weakening the immune systems, while others claim that the network actually caused COVID-19. Some people have taken the theory so seriously that there have been a series of arson attacks on telephone towers in the UK.

It comes as top talent like Woody Harrelson, MIA and Amir Khan falsely link 5G internet to the COVID-19 outbreak. \u26a0\ufe0f Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news & updates 11 Zombieland star Woody Harrelson has been warning his Instagram followers about the effects of 5GCredit: Getty Experts have warned that the mainstream news media struggles to complete with the vast reach of online stars. Politicians, celebrities and influencers were responsible for producing or spreading 20% of fake coronavirus claims online, according to Oxford's Reuters Institute. And these posts were responsible for more than two-thirds of total social media engagement. 11 Singer MIA has falsely linked 5G to coronavirus symptomsCredit: AFP / Getty Images A number of celebs have been caught up in fake coronavirus news scandals recently. Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has also repeatedly dismissed the seriousness of the coronavirus crisis, despite overwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary. Zombieland star Woody Harrelson has been warning his Instagram followers about the effects of 5G and shared a video labelled \u201cMeanwhile the Chinese are bringing 5g antennas down\u201d. His followers were quick to point out that the footage was from an old documentary filmed during protests in Hong Kong and that people were actually pulling down facial recognition cameras. Others slammed him for his irresponsible message: \u201cNooooooo Woody, not you! Spreading things like this is dangerous,\u201d said follower lise.km. Singer MIA posted a series of tweets urged the Government to \"turn off\" 5G until after the pandemic. And the star linked coronavirus symptoms to 5G towers. 11 Legendary Boxer Amir Khan was slammed for spreading 5G coronavirus conspiracy theories Celebs have been slammed for sharing the conspiracy theory, including Brits\u00a0Jason\u00a0Gardiner\u00a0and Callum Best, who posted similar claims that\u00a05G can impact the immune system. Boxer Amir Khan also released a series of bizarre videos where he blames the coronavirus on the building of \u201c5G towers\u201d. In the clips, Khan admits to \u201cwatching a lot of videos and stuff\u201d and says that the new tech could \u201cmake things bad\u201d. Just days ago\u00a0Khan offered the NHS the use of his four-storey wedding venue to help treat patients during the pandemic. TV icon Amanda Holden also stirred controversy after tweeting a link to a petition to ban 5G. But publicists for the Britain's Got Talent star later said that it was an accident \u2013 and that she doesn't believe in 5G conspiracies. Doctors and @WHO ask Governments to halt roll out of 5G. Here's why!! https://t.co/d6RDXkXaUz\u2014 Jason Gardiner (@officialJasonG) March 30, 2020 Crackpot arsonists have torched a number of 5G phone masts in the UK in response to online conspiracy theories. The first fire\u00a0took place in Birmingham, but several attacks on 5G towers quickly followed up and down the country. The theory originated last month after a video filmed at a US health conference\u00a0claimed Africa was not as affected by the disease because it is \"not a 5G region\". The theory was debunked further when the World Health Organisation confirmed there were thousands of Covid-19 cases in Africa. What is 5G, and is it safe? Here's what you need to know... Just like 4G (and 3G before that), 5G is simply a new generation of mobile internet Phone networks have tweaked the technology to deliver faster speeds \u2013 and have dubbed it the \"5th generation\", or 5 ll signals fall on the electromagnetic spectrum \u2013 from radio waves, to X-rays, and even visible light Phone networks use microwaves of a very specific frequency to deliver the internet to your iPhone or Android mobile This was true of 3G and 4G, and it's still true with 5G In the UK, 4G signals generally sit between 800MHz and 2.6GHz on the electromagnetic spectrum 5G is a little higher at 3.4GHz to 3.6GHz, but that's tiny when you consider that microwaves go up to 300GHz And visible light comes in at a range of around\u00a0430THz to 770THz That's more than a thousand times higher than the maximum microwave \u2013 and 100,000 higher than 5G Dangerous radiation, like UV rays, X-rays and gamma rays are also far higher up the spectrum still Online conspiracy theorists are claiming that 5G can cause harm Early theories suggested 5G could lead to cancer \u2013 and now crackpots have linked it to coronavirus too But it's simply impossible for 5G to cause any of these problems Radiation damages cells by breaking them apart, but 5G microwaves simply lack the power to do this 5G is a low-frequency radiation, far below infrared and visible light In fact, it's essential that 5G is low-frequency, because higher frequencies are less useful at delivering mobile signals over large areas We know that this level of radiation is safe, because otherwise the visible light from our televisions would have killed us a long time ago 11 5G is a very low-frequency form of radiation \u2013 far below visible light and infrared A spokesperson from the UK's Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: \"We have received several reports of criminal damage to phone masts and abuse of telecoms engineers apparently inspired by crackpot conspiracy theories circulating online. \"Those responsible for criminal acts will face the full force of the law. \"We must also see social media companies acting responsibly and taking much swifter action to stop nonsense spreading on their platforms, which encourages such acts.\" 11 Conspiracy theorists are setting 5G phone masts alight after a bogus coronavirus theory spreadCredit: SnapperSK 11 This mast was set alight in Birmingham, UKCredit: SnapperSK Hundreds of people have commented on shocking videos of the blaze posted on the Facebook group. One person wrote: \"Good needs to be done everywhere evil domination is coming\". Another said: \"It is time to act now. Any 5g tower in your area burn it down! Collect people and stand and fight this. Act now before it\u2019s too late!\" Others have posted pictures of masts near their homes, with users urging them to \"destroy\" it. While one person in a separate group is keeping a \"league\" table for cities setting the masts on fire. 11 5G conspiracy theories \u2013 why are they spreading? Here's what you need to know... The electromagnetic spectrum is nothing new. But the internet allows conspiracies to spread at speed, according to EE's Howard Jones. \"The problem is the level of research people are willing to do that supports the hypothesis they already hold,\" Howard told us. \"You can find lots of people talking about how 5G is not safe on the internet. \"But people talking about how 5G is safe just doesn't happen as much. There isn't as much objective and motivation there to say it is safe.\" However, there are lots of reasons 5G seems scary to people. Dr David Grimes explained: \"The first one is the difficult proving a negative. \"The other factor is that radiation is invisible. It's a scary word: we conflate difference concepts like radiation and radioactivity. \"Radiation is just the transmission of energy through a medium \u2013 light is radiation.\" \"The things being said about 5G were being said about normal mobile phones and masts in the late 90s. The claims aren't updated, they're just reiterated. He went on: \"Once you're suckered into these beliefs, it's hard to leave them. \"Even if we want to believe it, we almost have to put our questioning hat on, and say what evidence is there for that? \"Particularly online, you have to treat things with a massive pinch of salt. \"It's something as a society we have to learn, or we'll be taken advantage of by cranks or scheming Russians.\" The group has now been forced to warn users not to attack engineers. A post at the top of the site reads: \"We have been notified by certain members of the public that some individuals in this group have decided to target telecoms workers, as they believe and claim them to be 'criminals and genocidists'. \"You know who you are. If you continue to conduct yourselves like this you will be banned from this group.\" 11 Credit: SnapperSK The UK Government is now working with tech giants to quell the flow of conspiracy theories. Civil servants worked with WhatsApp to produce a verified coronavirus information chatbot that anyone can text for free. And the chat app has also limited chain-mail messages passed on five times from being widely distributed, allowing users to send the text to just one other person. Meanwhile, Youtube has banned all 5G conspiracy theory videos after David Icke linked the next-gen internet to coronavirus in an interview. 11 11 Could 5G, which has gone live in Britain and is already delivering ultra-fast internet speeds to smartphones, be harmful?

Earlier this week video footage emerged of a 5G mobile tower on fire in Birmingham that was targeted by anti-5G protesters. Similar arson attacks have taken in several places across the UK including Birmingham, Liverpool, and Melling. According to\u00a0BBC, at least three towers have been burned down, while the anti-5G protesters have posted videos of the arson attacks online with claims that there was a link between the 5G mobile technology and the spread of COVID-19.

In this treatment, plasma, a blood component, from a cured patient is transfused to a critically ill coronavirus patient.\u00a0 The ICMR recently allowed states to start clinical trials of plasma therapy. (Reuters) A 58-year-old doctor became the first coronavirus patient in Uttar Pradesh to receive plasma therapy as an experimental treatment for the disease at the King George Medical University (KGMU) here, a hospital official said on Monday.\u00a0According to doctors at the facility, the patient from Orai in Uttar Pradesh was administered 200 ml plasma on Sunday.\u00a0\u201cIt is for the first time that plasma therapy has been administered to a COVID-19 patient in any government hospital in Uttar Pradesh. Now we are anxiously waiting for the results,\u201d KGMU spokesperson Dr Sandeep Tiwari said on Monday.\u00a0His condition is being monitored, and if needed, he will be given a second dose later in the day or on Tuesday, the official said. The patient, a doctor from Orai in Uttar Pradesh, was administered plasma donated by a doctor from Canada who was the first COVID-19 patient admitted to KGMU and later recovered, Dr Tulika Chandra of the hospital\u2019s Blood Transfusion Medicine Department said.\u00a0Three coronavirus patients who have now recovered have so far donated their plasma for the treatment of others suffering from the disease. They include a resident doctor of the KGMU, Tauseef Khan, she said.

In this treatment, plasma, a blood component, from a cured patient is transfused to a critically ill coronavirus patient.\u00a0The blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 develops antibodies to fight the virus. This therapy uses antibodies from the blood of a cured coronavirus patient to treat another critical patient. The idea behind this therapy is that immunity can be transferred from a healthy person to a sick patient using convalescent plasma. Once the blood plasma of the recovered patient is infused with that of the second patient, the antibodies start fighting against coronavirus in the second person\u2019s body.\u00a0The process of donating plasma is similar to that of donating blood and takes about an hour. On April 21, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had asked the state\u2019s medical authorities to promote plasma therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients after examining its efficacy. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has recently allowed states to start clinical trials of plasma therapy. Many states like Kerala, Gujarat and Punjab have already started using it for treatment of coronavirus patients. Several other countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States, have also started plasma therapy trials.

Photo/ANI Plasma therapy of cured patients' blood can be used in fighting COVID-19: AIIMS Director ANI | Updated: Apr 12, 2020 16:01 IST New Delhi [India], April 12 (ANI): The blood of cured coronavirus patients can be used to treat COVID-19 patients, says Delhi AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria. \"Conversion plasma is a therapy that is being looked at as an option to treat the patients of COVID-19. If a coronavirus positive patient recovers, then he recovers by his body fighting the infection. To fight the infection, the body produces antibodies that stay in the blood,\" Dr Guleria told ANI on Sunday. He said this is the reason the doctors can ask the cured COVID-19 patients to donate their blood to another virus-infected patient to boost his immune system. \"If these antibodies are found to be in high amount in a person who has recovered from the coronavirus, we can ask him to donate his blood. From that blood, we take plasma which has a high concentration of anti-bodies. These antibodies can be transfused to another COVID-19 person, which boost the immune system of sick persons and fight the virus in a better manner,\" added Dr Guleria. The plasma therapy was used to deal with viruses like Ebola. It is now being tried in various institutes in India. \"If data suggests it is useful, we will use it in the near future,\" said Dr Guleria. The Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) on Saturday gave approval to Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) to treat COVID-19 patients with 'convalescent-plasma therapy,' which uses immune power gained by a recovered person to treat a sick person. SCTIMST comes under the Department of Science and Technology. \"Technically called convalescent-plasma therapy, the treatment aims at using immune power gained by a recovered person to treat a sick person. The Indian Council for Medical Research has given approval to SCTIMST for carrying out the novel treatment,\" said the Ministry of Science and Technology.

The Delhi and Kerala governments have received approval to use convalescent plasma therapy to treat severely-ill patients on a trial basis. By Meryl Sebastian Andreas Gebert / Reuters Sonja Krauthoefer of the University Hospital Erlangen checks donated blood and plasma samples, if the blood of the donor can be used for the production of therapeutic plasma for the treatment of seriously ill patients, in Erlangen, Germany, April 7, 2020.\u00a0 Convalescent plasma therapy is an experimental procedure and uses antibodies from the blood of cured patients to treat severely-ill COVID-19 patients. In India, the Delhi and Kerala governments have received approval to use convalescent plasma therapy to treat severely-ill patients on a trial basis. In Delhi, approval was received by the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences while Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology got the approval in Kerala. How does it work? People who survive an infectious disease like COVID-19 are generally left with blood containing antibodies, or proteins made by the body\u2019s immune system to fight off a virus. The blood component that carries the antibodies can be collected and given to newly infected patients. This is known as \u201cconvalescent\u00a0plasma.\u201d Plasma\u00a0from a single donor can be used to treat three or four patients, Reuters reports. The donors must have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and need to wait a defined period of time after they test negative for the disease before donating\u00a0plasma. Related...

Donors must also be healthy enough to meet the other requirements for blood donation \u2014 plus get an additional test to see if their antibody level is high enough. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to take plasma from someone who had a mediocre immune response. That wouldn\u2019t be helpful,\u201d said Dr. Julie Ledgerwood of US\u2019 National Institutes of Health told the Associated Press. Dr Sarin of Delhi\u2019s Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences told the Hindustan Times, \u201cIndia doesn\u2019t manufacture antibody testing kits. This makes it impossible to measure the antibody levels of a Covid-19 patient who has recovered. We\u2019re choosing only those healthy patients who have recovered, as they are likely to have a good immunity response,\u201d said Dr Sarin. The donors should also not have comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension, a heart condition or be below the age of 60. Dr. Jeffrey Henderson of Washington University School of Medicine told AP that the plasma therapy is \u201ca stopgap measure that we can put into place quickly\u201d. Henderson said it\u2019s \u201cnot a cure per se, but rather it is a way to reduce the severity of illness\u201d. In an article for The Conversation, virologist Anne Sheehy explained:\u00a0\u201cFor instance, each SARS-CoV-2 virus (which causes the Covid-19 disease) is covered by\u00a0distinctive spike proteins\u00a0that it uses like keys to unlock the doors to the cells it infects. By targeting these spikes \u2013 imagine covering the grooves of a key with tape \u2013 antibodies can make it nearly impossible for the virus to break in to human cells. Scientists call these kind of antibodies \u201cNAbs\u201d because they neutralise the virus before it can gain entry.\u201d Trials across the world Indian Council of Medical Research said that the therapy has been successful in limited clinical trials in some countries on patients who were in severe condition or on ventilator support.\u00a0 Among the countries conducting trials are the US, the UK, Italy, Iran, Mexico, Colombia and China.

The American Red Cross will help\u00a0collect\u00a0and distribute the plasma, the Associated Press reported. In China, a report published by scientists working in Shenzhen, suggested that plasma was\u00a0successful in treating five critically ill patients. Risks of the\u00a0plasma\u00a0therapy\u00a0can include infusion site reactions or other rare, allergic reactions. India\u2019s trials ICMR, the medical body at the forefront of India\u2019s coronavirus fight, does not recommend this as a treatment option outside of clinical trials. As per its guidelines, hospitals and institutions planning to provide this treatment can do so in a clinical trial with protocols which are cleared by the Institutional Ethics Committee with approval from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI). Last week, ICMR sought participation in a randomised controlled study to assess the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma to limit complications associated with COVID-19. It also sought participation in the study on therapeutic plasma exchange in improving the clinical status of COVID-19 patients.\u00a0 (With inputs from Reuters and the Associated Press) Related...

Pictured (from left) are his daughter Patty Segeda, ex-wife Pat Brazel Perkins, and daughters Vicki Ryback, Pamela Bogart and Ann Perkins.(Contributed by Patty Segeda) After 20 days on a ventilator, 74-year-old Glenn Perkins had stopped responding to commands to move his hands and wiggle his toes. Doctors at St. Luke\u2019s University Hospital in Warren County told his four daughters to consider making funeral arrangements, but the family wasn\u2019t ready to give up hope. One daughter, Patty Segeda, had heard about a treatment using convalescent plasma from patients who recently had recovered from the illness. Plasma contains antibodies that can be transferred to critically ill patients, giving their immune systems the boost needed to finally overcome COVID-19. Advertisement It worked for Perkins, who was the first COVID-19 patient St. Luke\u2019s University Health Network treated with plasma. Coronavirus recovery stories from the Lehigh Valley \u00bb On April 10, doctors were able to find a match for Perkins and give him a plasma transfusion. Two days later, on Easter Sunday, Perkins was finally taken off the ventilator that had kept him alive for 24 days. \u201cWhen the plasma came through, I didn\u2019t know if it would work because he was no longer fighting the virus. He no longer had the fever or the infection, he was just trying to come back from what it did to him,\u201d Segeda said. \u201cAs of right now, he\u2019s defying all the odds.\u201d Perkins, who lives in Phillipsburg, went home Friday to recover at his daughter Pamela Bogart\u2019s house in Bound Brook, New Jersey. Bogart also contracted the virus, but unlike her father, had an uneventful recovery. After 32 days in the hospital, Perkins lost 30 pounds and has to learn to walk again, but he beat the odds. Ventilators are seen as a last resort for coronavirus patients. An April 10 report in the United Kingdom showed that about two-thirds of the coronavirus patients who required ventilators there died. \u201cI felt like I was strung up in a dark room and I couldn\u2019t get a deep breath, like if I didn\u2019t get a deep breath I was going to die,\u201d Perkins said, recalling the experience. \u201cMy faith in God got me through.\u201d Now Perkins is focused on getting well enough so that he can return the favor by donating his own plasma. There is no cure for COVID-19, but convalescent plasma appears to be one of the more promising treatments. It has been around for more than a century, used during the 1918 flu pandemic and against numerous other infections such as measles and bacterial pneumonia before vaccines came along. Advertisement Dr. Kong Yuefeng, a recovered COVID-19 patient, donates plasma in Wuhan, China, in February. (AP) St. Luke\u2019s and Lehigh Valley Health Network are part of a nationwide effort overseen by the Mayo Clinic to advance the use of plasma in the fight against COVID-19. There are 1,622 hospitals participating around the country and more than 2,000 patients who have agreed to the treatment. \u201cWe don\u2019t like to use the word magic bullet or game changer. The true game-changer would be an absolute cure that works in the vast majority of people, or a vaccine,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey A. Jahre, chief of infectious diseases at St. Luke\u2019s. Convalescent plasma isn\u2019t the same as a vaccine, which trains a person\u2019s immune system to make its own antibodies. Plasma therapy gives a patient a temporary boost with someone else\u2019s antibodies and the effect is short-lived. \u201cWe are giving something that would be a temporary fix or push so that the body can kind of get over that edge and defeat the virus,\u201d Jahre said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a breakthrough. It\u2019s not a cure. It\u2019s a bridge until we get to that point.\u201d During more recent global outbreaks, researchers tested convalescent plasma in small clinical studies and found it had positive effects against coronaviruses that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), as well as against H1N1 influenza, according to the Mayo Clinic website. However, the same approach turned out not to be effective against Ebola, which is not a coronavirus but a filovirus. There are still a lot of questions surrounding the use of plasma to treat COVID-19, said Dr. Timothy Friel, an infectious disease specialist with LVHN. Advertisement \u201cWhat is the appropriate dose? When in the course of their illness do they get it? Do you save it for the sickest people who are intubated and on the ventilator? Do you give it earlier in the disease?\u201d Friel said. As of Monday, LVHN had treated five patients with plasma and another 12 were on the waiting list. Some of those patients improved while others got worse despite the treatment, Friel said. Not all of them were on ventilators. St. Luke\u2019s plans to treat more patients with plasma and is working with Miller-Keystone Blood Center and the American Red Cross to secure more donations. The health network recently referred 23 recovered patients to Miller Keystone to donate. Plasma typically is administered intravenously by a single infusion over the course of an hour. Because of the limited supply, there\u2019s no possibility of repeat dosing, and none of the protocols recommend repeat dosing anyway, Friel said. He and Jahare are saving the treatment for their sickest patients. Any time a patient receives a blood product there is the risk of an adverse reaction, so that needs to be weighed against the possible benefit, Friel said. Clinical trials being conducted by Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore may result in standard guidelines, and could lead to better treatments. On April 3, the Food and Drug Administration approved a clinical trial specifically for Johns Hopkins that will allow researchers to further test the therapy as a means of preventing sickness in healthy people who are at high risk, like front-line medical workers. There is a separate clinical trial scheduled to start in the next week or so that will test the effectiveness of plasma therapy in treating COVID-19. In that randomized clinical trial, half the participants across the country will get convalescent plasma and the other half will get samples that don\u2019t have COVID-19 antibodies, said Dr. David Sullivan, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \u201cEverything has been noncontrolled and it\u2019s just anecdotal. We do know 1 or 2% of people who get sick never make antibodies and about 30% make a low amount, and we don\u2019t know if that low amount will influence the outcomes of the disease,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cThis is the first step en route to better treatments,\u201d he said. Sullivan is hopeful that widespread collection of convalescent plasma will eventually lead to immunoglobulin therapy, which is when antibodies are used to treat medical conditions. While that would allow doctors to treat more people, immunoglobulin therapy is highly regulated and requires plasma samples from thousands of donors, Sullivan explained. \u201cThe benefit is you don\u2019t have to type and cross-match, you can give it to all blood types. It\u2019s pure antibodies,\u201d Sullivan said. Advertisement Right now, researchers mainly are focused on proving plasma therapy works so it can get approval from the FDA as a widespread coronavirus treatment. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to prove this is effective, it\u2019s like proving a drug is effective,\" Sullivan said. \u201cIf you get the virus, this treatment would prevent bad outcomes, but it could also be used to prevent you from getting the infection.\u201d Glenn Perkins (Contributed by Patty Segeda) In the Lehigh Valley, Miller-Keystone Blood Center in Allentown and the American Red Cross are both collecting plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19. Miller-Keystone collected its first donation on April 8 and in two weeks had five more donors, said Vice President and Medical Director Dr. Kip Kuttner. One donation can provide up to four doses of plasma. Donors must be symptom-free for at least 19 days and provide two tests showing they are negative for COVID-19, Kuttner said. There haven\u2019t been many donations because cases didn\u2019t start showing up in the Lehigh Valley until March, so many people who had the virus haven\u2019t been symptom-free long enough. The Red Cross has collection sites in Wilkes-Barre, Scranton and Philadelphia, though as of this week, has not received any donations in Northeast Pennsylvania, said Alana Mauger, the biomedical communications manager for Red Cross Blood Services in Northeastern and Central Pennsylvania. Perkins believes the plasma saved his life. \u201cIt was a blessing, because without it I would not be here,\u201d he said. Morning Call reporter Christina Tatu can be reached at 610-820-6583 or ctatu@mcall.com. How to donate Miller-Keystone Blood Center: Eligibility screening forms are at giveapint.org/give-blood/covid-plasma. For additional information, contact Diane Wiest, senior director of risk management, at 800-223-6667 ext. 1245 or dwiest@giveapint.org. American Red Cross: Prospective donors should register at RedCrossBlood.org/plasma4covid. Eligible donors will receive an appointment to donate convalescent plasma at a location near them.

According to Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada\u2019s chief public health officer, masks \u2014 both medical and non-medical \u2014 can be effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. People who don\u2019t have symptoms can wear non-medical masks when in public as \u201can additional measure\u201d to protect other people, Tam said in a news conference Monday.

It may also be possible that people who have the virus but never develop symptoms are able to transmit the virus as well.

Below, experts answer your most pressing questions about masks during the coronavirus pandemic. Types of masks There are two kinds of medical-grade masks. The first is a surgical mask, which is a disposable, loose-fitting mask that covers your nose mouth and chin. The second is an N95 respirator, which is a tight-fitting face mask that can filter the air particles breathed through it, according to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. 3:54 Coronavirus outbreak: The life-and-death decisions doctors face Coronavirus outbreak: The life-and-death decisions doctors face A \u201cnon-medical mask,\u201d according to Tam, is one made at home with material from cotton shirts, sheets or bandannas, and connected to one\u2019s ears by elastic bands or hair ties. \u201cA non-medical mask can reduce the chance of your respiratory droplets coming into contact with others or land on surfaces.\u201d Wearing a non-medical mask in the community, however, \u201chas not been proven to protect the person wearing it,\u201d Tam reiterated.

Hajdu said she \u201cwouldn\u2019t hesitate to wear [one],\u201d but that she would be sure to follow instructions on how to do so properly from Tam. How to wear a mask properly The only way masks are effective is if they cover both your mouth and your nose, said Dr. Jeff Kwong, an infectious diseases epidemiologist and professor at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto. That\u2019s true of both medical masks (surgical masks and N95 masks), as well as non-medical masks made at home. \u201cWhat I find a bit funny \u2026 is when you go out and see people wearing the mask around their neck, near their chin. It\u2019s covering the mouth but not the nose,\u201d Kwong said.

This can counteract any benefits the mask may have. There\u2019s very little data on the efficacy of homemade masks. Kwong predicts they\u2019re probably not as effective as medical masks, \u201cbut I still think some protection is still better than no protection,\u201d he said. Masks do not replace physical distancing, hand hygiene Masks (medical and non-medical) do not replace the public health measures already put in place to help curb the spread of COVID-19, Tam said Monday. \u201cYou must continue to practise physical distancing and good hygiene by frequent handwashing and regularly disinfect high-touch surfaces,\u201d she said.

If you must go out, physical distancing and good hand hygiene are your next strongest lines of defence.

Here are some things you need to know: Health officials caution against all international travel. Returning travellers are legally obligated to self-isolate for 14 days, beginning March 26, in case they develop symptoms and to prevent spreading the virus to others. Some provinces and territories have also implemented additional recommendations or enforcement measures to ensure those returning to the area self-isolate. Symptoms can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing \u2014 very similar to a cold or flu. Some people can develop a more severe illness. People most at risk of this include older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. If you develop symptoms, contact public health authorities. To prevent the virus from spreading, experts recommend frequent handwashing and coughing into your sleeve. They also recommend minimizing contact with others, staying home as much as possible and maintaining a distance of two metres from other people if you go out.

The World Health Organisation advises to only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Picture: Mark Stewart Health Should you be wearing a face mask? by Shireen Khalil 27th Mar 2020 4:51 PM 0 More and more Australians are wearing protective face masks or trying to get their hands on them. But if you are a healthy individual, there is no need for you to wear a face mask. The World Health Organisation advises to only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. On its website, WHO stated that wearing multiple face masks is \"not effective\" against the novel coronavirus and can actually be harmful. How? If you wear a mask incorrectly it can actually \"increase\" your chances of getting the virus, according to infection prevention specialist Eli Perencevich, MD, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Iowa's College of Medicine. \"Masks won't protect the average person. Because they will wear them incorrectly and autocontaminate themselves. I've never seen a person practice hand hygiene before removing a mask in public and then after removing the mask,\" Prof Perencevich said in a recent Twitter post. He told Forbes that the average healthy person does not need to have a mask, and they shouldn't be wearing masks. Prof Perencevich said if people don't wash their hands before taking off a mask, \"you could increase your risk\". The World Health Organisation advises to only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Picture: Mark Stewart \"There's no evidence that wearing masks on healthy people will protect them,\" he said. \"They wear them incorrectly, and they can increase the risk of infection because they're touching their face more often.\" He explained the one time you would want to wear a mask is if you're sick and you have to leave the house. \"If you have the flu or think you have COVID, that's when you'd put on a mask to protect others. In your house, if you feel like you're sick, you should wear a mask to protect your family members.\" According to WHO, if you wear a mask, then you must know how to use it and dispose of it properly, adding those who are sick can wear a mask if they are coughing and sneezing. But they are \"effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water\". Masks won\u2019t protect the average person. Because they will wear them incorrectly and autocontaminate themselves. I\u2019ve never seen a person practice hand hygiene before removing a mask in public and then after removing the mask\u2014 \ud835\ude40\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5e \ud835\ude4b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude6b\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d \ud83e\udd1a \ud83e\uddfc (@eliowa) March 1, 2020 \u00a0 HOW TO PROPERLY WEAR A MASK The WHO also said that before putting on a mask strict hygiene rules should be followed including cleaning hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. \"Cover mouth and nose with (the) mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask,\" it said. \"Avoid touching the mask while using it; if you do, clean your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.\" Critically, the mask needs to be changed as soon as it is damp and cannot be used again. \"To remove the mask: remove it from behind (do not touch the front of mask); discard immediately in a closed bin; clean hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.\" The agency has published mythbusters on the disease and is battling an \"infodemic\" of false information about how coronavirus spreads. If you wear a mask incorrectly it can actually \u2018increase\u2019 your chances of getting the virus, according to an infection prevention specialist. Picture: Dan Peled/AAP \u00a0 LITTLE EVIDENCE WEARING A MASKS PREVENTS CORONAVIRUS Public Health England's head of emerging infections Dr Jake Dunning said there is \"very little evidence of a widespread benefit\" in members of the public wearing masks. \"Face masks must be worn correctly, changed frequently, removed properly, disposed of safely and used in combination with good universal hygiene behaviour in order for them to be effective,\" he told the Independent. Doctors, professors and experts from around the world have continued to say that the best way to protect yourself is by taking preventive actions staying at home if you're sick, being diligent with hygiene (washing your hands with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds) and practising social distancing. In Australia, promising new figures show social distancing measures may be starting to have an impact on coronavirus infections in NSW and Victoria. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian today confirmed there had been 186 new cases of COVID-19 in the state, which continues the slight reduction in new cases since it reached a high of 211 on Wednesday, before it dropped to 190 new cases on Thursday. Victorian numbers were also looking more promising, with cases there declining from a high of 80 new cases on Sunday, to 51 cases on Monday and 48 cases on Tuesday. There was an increase to 65 cases on Wednesday but this dropped to 46 cases on Thursday. THE TYPES OF MASKS There is medical grade respirators (3M) that health care professionals wear when treating someone with a serious contagious disease. The type of face covering that reduces exposure to airborne particles - including protecting the wearer from viruses and bacteria - is called a respirator. The type of personal protection equipment (PPE) that healthcare workers wear when treating someone with a serious contagious disease is a medical respirator, Forbes reports. They must have an efficiency rating of \"N95,\" \"FFP2,\" or a similar rating that refers to how many particles - and of what size - can't get through. It protects the wearer from getting sick and protects the patient from the wearer's germs. According to Forbes, those people who use medical respirators have received training in how to wear them to protect themselves, such as ensuring the mask forms an airtight seal with their face. Masks are essential for people who are suspected or confirmed of having COVID-19, or looking after someone who is unwell, experts say. Picture: Joel Carrett/AAP \u00a0 GLOBAL SHORTAGE OF MASKS Another reason why experts have advised against wearing masks unless you're sick is because there is a global shortage and medical professionals are in need of it the most. US surgeon general Jerome Adams, MD, pleaded on Twitter for people to refrain from purchasing masks. \"Seriously people-STOP BUYING MASKS!\" he demanded. \"They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching ", "label": 0, "Q0": "Q0", "c_score": "0.48814992075"}

Reiterating that the risk to the public is low, Ontario\u2019s Ministry of Health and Long-term Care is currently advising doctors and nurses that a fit-tested N95 mask, used appropriately and changed according to infection control best practices, will prevent the transmission of coronavirus. Used to guard against measles and tuberculosis, N95 masks are the best option in dealing with airborne viruses but evidence shows COVID-19 is spread by respiratory droplets that have either been coughed and sprayed into the air or contaminated a hard surface another person touches in the environment. Once more is learned about COVID-19, N95s could be reconsidered for health-care professionals. \u201cThey are recommended to health care providers out of an abundance of caution when we didn\u2019t know much about COVID-19,\u201d said Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health (WDGPH) spokesperson Chuck Ferguson. \u201cA procedural or surgical mask, along with eye protection and protective clothing, may be adequate,\" Ferguson said. \"Currently, the province is still recommending N95s for health-care workers only.\u201d As of Saturday, March 7, there were 57 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Canada, including 28 in Ontario and 27 in British Columbia. Quebec recently confirmed its third case and Alberta had two. A total of 31 people have been tested for COVID-19 within Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health\u2019s (WDGPH) jurisdiction, including at least eight at Headwaters Health Care Centre, but none have tested positive for COVID-19. We reached out to WDGPH\u2019s infectious disease control unit and asked a number of questions surrounding the use of masks by health-care professionals and why they aren't recommended for members of the public. Here is what we learned. THE N95 MASK\u00a0(recommended for health-care workers only) Out of an \u201cabundance of caution,\u201d health-care professionals are wearing fit-tested N95 masks when conducting clinical examinations and collecting tests from individuals suspected of having COVID-19. Individuals must be fit-tested to ensure there is an \u201cairtight seal\u201d around the nose and mouth, to prevent droplet particles from making contact with their mouth and nose or from being inhaled. This N95 mask seal is verified during a formal fit test to ensure no air moves in or out along the borders of the mask during exercises like movement, inhalation, exhalation or speaking. \u201cThese masks are designed to prevent the smallest airborne particles from getting through,\u201d WDGPH\u2019s infectious disease control experts advised, noting N95s are specifically being used when health-care professional conduct clinical exams and collect tests from individuals suspected of having COVID-19. \u201cThis recommendation goes over and above what other countries are recommending but is based (on) the precautionary principle, which means that until more scientific evidence is in on this new emerging disease, the highest level of protection for masks will be used.\u201d For the time being, health-care workers have been advised to wear N95 fit-tested masks until more is known and proven about the transmission of the COVID-19 virus. \u201cOnce all the research is analyzed on the COVID-19 outbreak, it might be proven that a procedure mask would also be protective, but this has not been fully proven yet,\u201d WDGPH infectious disease experts advised. \"Health-care workers have been advised to wear N95 fit-tested masks until more is known and proven about the transmission of the COVID-19 virus.\" GENERAL PUBLIC (No mask, unless you show respiratory symptoms) It is not recommended that members of the general public use masks to protect against coronavirus, as WDGPH says the risk of transmission is low at this time. Masks are only recommended for individuals showing symptoms of coronavirus and those caring for patients with COVID-19 symptoms, such as fever, sneezing, coughing and difficulty breathing. When it comes to coronavirus, respiratory droplets coughed or sprayed into the air could infect another person within six feet of the ill individual or contaminate hard surfaces in the environment. Contaminated surfaces could infect another person\u2019s hands, which may eventually touch their noses, mouth or eyes before hands are washed. \u201cIt is more important that sick people self-isolate or wear a mask so they do not expose people to respiratory viruses through coughing and sneezing,\u201d WDGPH\u2019s infectious disease control experts explained. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes wearing a medical mask is \u201cone\u201d of the prevention measures to limit the spread of certain respiratory diseases, including COVID-19, in affected areas. Wearing a mask, however, requires strict adherence to infection control principles. They must be changed frequently and discarded properly during the day and every time an individual removes a mask to drink and eat. There is a high chance of contaminating the outside of the mask and then contaminating one's hands, and then eventually facial mucous membranes. Even health-care workers do not wear masks continuously in the health-care environment, but only when faced with a patient client showing respiratory symptoms.

PROPER MASK PROTOCOL If medical masks are worn, their appropriate use and disposal is essential in ensuring they are effective in avoiding any increase in risk of transmission. Here\u2019s what the WHO wants you to keep in mind. \u2022 Avoid touching the mask while it is in use. \u2022 Remove the mask by using an appropriate technique (i.e. do not touch the front, but remove the lace from behind). \u2022 Whenever you inadvertently touch a used mask, clean your hands by using an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water if visibly soiled. \u2022 Replace masks with a new clean, dry mask as soon as they become damp/humid. \u2022 Do not reuse single-use masks. \u2022 Discard single-use masks after each use and dispose of them immediately upon removal. \u2022 Cloth (i.e. cotton or gauze) masks are not recommended under any circumstance. HOW TO PUT ON, USE, OR REMOVE A MASK OK, you or someone you know is coughing and sneezing. It\u2019s time to mask up. It\u2019s as simple as that, right? No. If you don\u2019t put on or remove a mask properly, it won't help. Here\u2019s what you need to do. \u2022 Before putting on a mask, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. \u2022 Locate the metal strip at the top of the mask and place it over your nose bridge, then secure the elastics around your ears or tie the strings behind your head. Make sure it covers your nose, mouth and chin. There should be no gaps between your face and the mask. \u2022 Avoid touching the mask while using it, as it may be contaminated. If you accidentally touch the front of it while wearing the mask, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. \u2022 If your mask becomes damp or humid, replace it with a new dry mask. Never reuse single-use masks, and discard them into closed bins immediately after each use. \u2022 Remove the mask from behind (do not touch the front of mask), discard it immediately in a closed bin, and clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT COVID-19 Symptoms of COVID-19 include a fever, cough and shortness of breath, and can be mild to severe in nature. Severe complications can include kidney failure, pneumonia and, sometimes, death. There is currently no treatment for COVID-19 and no vaccine. Everyday precautions include washing your hands often with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer; sneezing or coughing into your sleeve; avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth; avoiding contact with those who are sick, and staying home if you are sick. COVID-19 is believed to spread through respiratory droplets when you cough or sneeze; through close personal contact such as touching or shaking hands; touching something with the virus on it and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes before washing your hands. The incubation period for the virus is up to 14 days after you have been exposed. If you are travelling to an area of the world known to have COVID-19 cases, avoid high-risk areas such as farms and live animal markets, as well as contact with animals \u2013 including pigs, chickens, ducks and wild birds (alive or dead) \u2013 and surfaces with animal droppings. Public health officials continue to say the risk of the virus spreading in this country is low. If you have any questions or concerns regarding COVID-19, visit wdgpublichealth.ca/coronavirus\u00a0or call WDG Public Health\u2019s coronavirus call centre at 1-800-265-7293, ext. 7006, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. The Upper Grand District School Board has also created a COVID-19 website.

The N95 mask: Why Ontario health care workers in coronavirus crosshairs wear it \u2013 and what COVID-19 mask they may get next News Mar 08, 2020 by Chris Halliday Orangeville Banner The N95 mask is believed to be the \u201cbest protection\u201d against coronavirus for Ontario health-care professionals, but \u2013 just like the global response to COVID-19 \u2013 the situation is constantly evolving. Reiterating that the risk to the public is low, Ontario\u2019s Ministry of Health and Long-term Care is currently advising doctors and nurses that a fit-tested N95 mask, used appropriately and changed according to infection control best practices, will prevent the transmission of coronavirus. Used to guard against measles and tuberculosis, N95 masks are the best option in dealing with airborne viruses but evidence shows COVID-19 is spread by respiratory droplets that have either been coughed and sprayed into the air or contaminated a hard surface another person touches in the environment.

The World Health Organisation advises to only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Picture: Mark Stewart Health Should you be wearing a face mask? by Shireen Khalil 27th Mar 2020 4:51 PM 0 More and more Australians are wearing protective face masks or trying to get their hands on them. But if you are a healthy individual, there is no need for you to wear a face mask. The World Health Organisation advises to only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. On its website, WHO stated that wearing multiple face masks is \"not effective\" against the novel coronavirus and can actually be harmful. How? If you wear a mask incorrectly it can actually \"increase\" your chances of getting the virus, according to infection prevention specialist Eli Perencevich, MD, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Iowa's College of Medicine. \"Masks won't protect the average person. Because they will wear them incorrectly and autocontaminate themselves. I've never seen a person practice hand hygiene before removing a mask in public and then after removing the mask,\" Prof Perencevich said in a recent Twitter post. He told Forbes that the average healthy person does not need to have a mask, and they shouldn't be wearing masks. Prof Perencevich said if people don't wash their hands before taking off a mask, \"you could increase your risk\". The World Health Organisation advises to only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Picture: Mark Stewart \"There's no evidence that wearing masks on healthy people will protect them,\" he said. \"They wear them incorrectly, and they can increase the risk of infection because they're touching their face more often.\" He explained the one time you would want to wear a mask is if you're sick and you have to leave the house. \"If you have the flu or think you have COVID, that's when you'd put on a mask to protect others. In your house, if you feel like you're sick, you should wear a mask to protect your family members.\" According to WHO, if you wear a mask, then you must know how to use it and dispose of it properly, adding those who are sick can wear a mask if they are coughing and sneezing. But they are \"effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water\". Masks won\u2019t protect the average person. Because they will wear them incorrectly and autocontaminate themselves.

If you wear a mask incorrectly it can actually \u2018increase\u2019 your chances of getting the virus, according to an infection prevention specialist. Picture: Dan Peled/AAP \u00a0 LITTLE EVIDENCE WEARING A MASKS PREVENTS CORONAVIRUS Public Health England's head of emerging infections Dr Jake Dunning said there is \"very little evidence of a widespread benefit\" in members of the public wearing masks. \"Face masks must be worn correctly, changed frequently, removed properly, disposed of safely and used in combination with good universal hygiene behaviour in order for them to be effective,\" he told the Independent. Doctors, professors and experts from around the world have continued to say that the best way to protect yourself is by taking preventive actions staying at home if you're sick, being diligent with hygiene (washing your hands with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds) and practising social distancing. In Australia, promising new figures show social distancing measures may be starting to have an impact on coronavirus infections in NSW and Victoria. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian today confirmed there had been 186 new cases of COVID-19 in the state, which continues the slight reduction in new cases since it reached a high of 211 on Wednesday, before it dropped to 190 new cases on Thursday. Victorian numbers were also looking more promising, with cases there declining from a high of 80 new cases on Sunday, to 51 cases on Monday and 48 cases on Tuesday. There was an increase to 65 cases on Wednesday but this dropped to 46 cases on Thursday. THE TYPES OF MASKS There is medical grade respirators (3M) that health care professionals wear when treating someone with a serious contagious disease. The type of face covering that reduces exposure to airborne particles - including protecting the wearer from viruses and bacteria - is called a respirator. The type of personal protection equipment (PPE) that healthcare workers wear when treating someone with a serious contagious disease is a medical respirator, Forbes reports. They must have an efficiency rating of \"N95,\" \"FFP2,\" or a similar rating that refers to how many particles - and of what size - can't get through. It protects the wearer from getting sick and protects the patient from the wearer's germs. According to Forbes, those people who use medical respirators have received training in how to wear them to protect themselves, such as ensuring the mask forms an airtight seal with their face. Masks are essential for people who are suspected or confirmed of having COVID-19, or looking after someone who is unwell, experts say. Picture: Joel Carrett/AAP \u00a0 GLOBAL SHORTAGE OF MASKS Another reason why experts have advised against wearing masks unless you're sick is because there is a global shortage and medical professionals are in need of it the most.

The Director-General (D-G) of NCDC, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, issued \u00a0the advisory on Tuesday in Abuja while giving an update on COVID-19. Ihekweazu said that NCDC recognised\u00a0 the need for guidance on COVID-19 prevention,\u00a0 and remained committed to keeping Nigerians informed on verified ways to stay safe against the pandemic. He said that globally, there was a debate on the effectiveness of masks as a preventive measure against COVID-19. According to him, evidence in favour of the use of masks include that it can\u00a0 prevent\u00a0 an asymptomatic\u00a0 person (a person who never develops symptoms)\u00a0 from transmitting the disease as well as prevent transmission during \u00a0pre-symptomatic period ( before a person develops symptoms). He added that there was emerging evidence of the ability of a mask to prevent contact with respiratory droplets. The D-G said that comparisons also appeared to suggest better outcomes in countries that used masks as a general policy. \u201cSources of concern have been that people who wear face masks may feel protected and ignore physical distancing advice. \u201cIn addition, if face masks are not worn correctly, disposed of appropriately or if people touch their faces more frequently due to adjustments of face masks they are wearing, they run a higher risk of infection,\u201d he, however, said. He said that in view of these, the NCDC\u00a0 advised\u00a0that wearing of face masks or equivalents was\u00a0 recommended as an optional\u00a0 layer to be used in addition to other measures such as physical distancing, hand washing and respiratory hygiene measures. \u201cMasks have to be properly disposed of in waste bins. Improper handling and frequently touching of masks can increase the risk of infection. \u201cImprovised masks are an option as long as they are properly washed regularly. \u201cThey can be made out of cloth or other materials,\u201d he advised. The D-G said that usage of face masks was particularly advisable when attending\u00a0 gatherings \u201cwhere it is absolutely necessary to attend\u201d. He listed such gatherings to include shopping outlets, markets and pharmacies. Ihekweazu noted that patients and healthcare workers needed\u00a0 masks the most. He advised that old persons \u00a0with medical conditions such as diabetes should\u00a0 wear masks since they were at a higher risk of the infection. He also \u00a0advised that face masks should be used by those\u00a0 with respiratory problems and those already exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms and awaiting testing. Ihekweazu said it was important to note that usage of face masks alone could not be relied upon to prevent COVID-19. He said that physical distancing and regular hand washing\u00a0 were necessary for protection against\u00a0 the virus. NAN reports that according to the World Health Organisation, medical face masks should be worn primarily by people who show symptoms of COVID-19, health workers and people who are taking care of people with COVID-19 in close settings (at home or in a health care facilities.

The World Health Organisation advises to only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Picture: Mark Stewart Health Should you be wearing a face mask? by Shireen Khalil 27th Mar 2020 4:51 PM More and more Australians are wearing protective face masks or trying to get their hands on them. But if you are a healthy individual, there is no need for you to wear a face mask. The World Health Organisation advises to only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. On its website, WHO stated that wearing multiple face masks is \"not effective\" against the novel coronavirus and can actually be harmful. How? If you wear a mask incorrectly it can actually \"increase\" your chances of getting the virus, according to infection prevention specialist Eli Perencevich, MD, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Iowa's College of Medicine. \"Masks won't protect the average person. Because they will wear them incorrectly and autocontaminate themselves. I've never seen a person practice hand hygiene before removing a mask in public and then after removing the mask,\" Prof Perencevich said in a recent Twitter post. He told Forbes that the average healthy person does not need to have a mask, and they shouldn't be wearing masks. Prof Perencevich said if people don't wash their hands before taking off a mask, \"you could increase your risk\". The World Health Organisation advises to only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Picture: Mark Stewart \"There's no evidence that wearing masks on healthy people will protect them,\" he said. \"They wear them incorrectly, and they can increase the risk of infection because they're touching their face more often.\" He explained the one time you would want to wear a mask is if you're sick and you have to leave the house. \"If you have the flu or think you have COVID, that's when you'd put on a mask to protect others. In your house, if you feel like you're sick, you should wear a mask to protect your family members.\" According to WHO, if you wear a mask, then you must know how to use it and dispose of it properly, adding those who are sick can wear a mask if they are coughing and sneezing. But they are \"effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water\". Masks won\u2019t protect the average person. Because they will wear them incorrectly and autocontaminate themselves.

If you wear a mask incorrectly it can actually \u2018increase\u2019 your chances of getting the virus, according to an infection prevention specialist. Picture: Dan Peled/AAP \u00a0 LITTLE EVIDENCE WEARING A MASKS PREVENTS CORONAVIRUS Public Health England's head of emerging infections Dr Jake Dunning said there is \"very little evidence of a widespread benefit\" in members of the public wearing masks. \"Face masks must be worn correctly, changed frequently, removed properly, disposed of safely and used in combination with good universal hygiene behaviour in order for them to be effective,\" he told the Independent. Doctors, professors and experts from around the world have continued to say that the best way to protect yourself is by taking preventive actions staying at home if you're sick, being diligent with hygiene (washing your hands with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds) and practising social distancing. In Australia, promising new figures show social distancing measures may be starting to have an impact on coronavirus infections in NSW and Victoria. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian today confirmed there had been 186 new cases of COVID-19 in the state, which continues the slight reduction in new cases since it reached a high of 211 on Wednesday, before it dropped to 190 new cases on Thursday. Victorian numbers were also looking more promising, with cases there declining from a high of 80 new cases on Sunday, to 51 cases on Monday and 48 cases on Tuesday. There was an increase to 65 cases on Wednesday but this dropped to 46 cases on Thursday.

Some members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party have claimed that cow urine and dung can prevent and cure COVID-19. The chief of the Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha (All India Hindu Union) group hosted\u00a0a cow urine drinking event on Saturday in New Delhi, hoping that the practice staves off the coronavirus. Many Hindus consider the cow to be sacred. Some leaders from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party have advocated cow urine or cow dung for its \"medicinal\" properties. \"We have been drinking cow urine for 21 years, we also take a bath in cow dung. We have never felt the need to consume\u00a0English medicine, said Om Prakash, one of the party attendees.

Experts have repeatedly warned that cow urine and dung, as well as certain traditional medicines, does not cure illnesses such COVID-19, also known as coronavirus,\u00a0or cancer. \"There is no scientific validation that any of these traditional medicines work to prevent coronavirus,\"\u00a0virologist and traditional medicine researcher Debprasad Chattopadhyay told Germany's\u00a0Deutsche Presse-Agentur news agency. \"Cow dung and urine are waste material, there is no test that validates or proves they are good for us,\" he said.

Racist propaganda\u00a0 Chief of the All India Hindu Union Chakrapani Maharaj posed for photographs during Saturday's party as he placed a spoon full of cow urine near the face of a caricature of the coronavirus. Maharaj's political party was established to protect the rights of India's Hindu community and safeguard the Hindu religion. Photographs of the event have circulated on online media in India. One photograph showed a party attendee pouring urine into a cup, right next to a poster depicting the coronavirus as an angry fire-breathing half-man-half-monster pursuing Chinese people who are photoshopped eating various animal meats and the words, \"Save us corona!\" Many in the Hindu-majority nation of 1.3 billion consider cows sacred and in recent years have made several assertions about the liquid being an elixir 'Cow dung or yoga' The spread of the coronavirus in India has triggered numerous controversial health benefit claims, particularly surrounding traditional medicines such as plant and mineral extracts and yoga. One example is the belief that applying two drops of sesame oil into the nostrils each day can ward off the coronavirus. Baba Ramdev, one of India's most famous yoga masters, said on February 22 that \"if you practice yoga, your immunity increases which can help save a person in case they are infected with the virus. If immunity is low, the person cannot be saved.\" The federal government's Ayush Ministry, which oversees the country's traditional medicine systems, issued an advisory on January 29 concerning Ayurveda remedies and unani practices (alternative medicines) and homeopathy. \"Making random claims around treatment or prevention of the coronavirus through cow dung or yoga is irresponsible, whether it comes from the government or anyone else,\" said Anant Bhan, a researcher in bioethics and global health. Myths vs. facts: How true is coronavirus information on the web? Does rinsing your nose with saline protect you? According to the World Health Organization, there is no evidence to support claims that a saline solution will \"kill\u201d the virus and protect you. Myths vs. facts: How true is coronavirus information on the web? Will gargling mouthwash prevent an infection? Certain brands of mouthwash may eliminate particular microbes from your saliva for a few minutes, but, according to the WHO, this does not protect you from the new coronavirus. Myths vs. facts: How true is coronavirus information on the web? Can eating garlic help? This dubious claim has been spreading like wildfire across social media. Though it is possible that garlic may have some antimicrobial properties, there is no evidence to suggest from the current coronavirus outbreak that eating this bulb will protect people from the virus. Myths vs. facts: How true is coronavirus information on the web? Can pets spread COVID-19? There is no evidence to suggest pets, such as cats and dogs, can be infected or transmit the coronavirus. Regularly washing your hands with soap and water after touching your beloved moggy or pooch will help stop the spread of bacteria that they commonly carry, such as E. coli and salmonella. Myths vs. facts: How true is coronavirus information on the web? Can the corona virus be transmitted via air mail? People receiving parcels from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus, as the virus does not survive long on objects. Due to the poor survivability of the coronavirus on surfaces, there is a very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks. Myths vs. facts: How true is coronavirus information on the web? Is there a vaccine yet? The new coronavirus needs its own vaccine. Pneumonia vaccines such as the pneumococcal and the Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine will not protect you against the coronavirus. Myths vs. facts: How true is coronavirus information on the web? Do bleach products protect you? Bleach/chlorine-based disinfectants, solvents, 75% ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform can kill the 2019-nCoV on hard surfaces; however, they have little or no impact if you put them on your skin. Myths vs. facts: How true is coronavirus information on the web? Avoid direct contact! To avoid a coronavirus infection, always cook raw foods thoroughly. It is also advisable to avoid direct contact with people who are sick. Myths vs. facts: How true is coronavirus information on the web? Keep your hands clean! Frequently washing your hands with soap and water can help prevent an infection. You can also use an alcohol-based sanitizing gel instead. If you have to cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow. If you have contracted the disease without knowing it, coughing or sneezing in this manner might help to reduce the spread.

The programme drew sharp criticism from the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and opposition Congress, whereas the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) remained tightlipped. \u201cThis is completely unscientific and absurd.

TRAVEL : Restrictions and how to safeguard FAQs: Be Informed \"We believe that consuming cow urine would further strengthen our immunity and protect us from the coronavirus,\" one of the organisers said. The organisers vouched for its \"miraculous\" properties while offering cow urine to others. The programme drew sharp criticism from the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and opposition Congress, whereas the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) remained tightlipped. \"This is completely unscientific and absurd. When scientists across the world are working to fight this virus, such incidents are not only shameful but are also a crime. I would urge everyone not to fall into such a trap,\" state Parliamentary Affairs Minister Partha Chatterjee said. Congress's chief whip in the state Assembly Manoj Chakraborty slammed the \"saffron camp\" and said, \"it is due to their obsession with cow that such superstitions have spread in the society\".

LATEST NEWS Coronavirus Disc Drugs such as Cow Urine, Fasting and Cognac Promoted by Authorities Worldwide By Jermaine Hoffman - April 17, 2020 0 33 Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp Highly questionable treatments for COVID-19 including drinking cow urine have been promoted by political leaders since the pandemic began. A number of proof-free solutions that also include fasting and drinking cognac have been heralded by authorities around the world. In India, a \u201ccow urine party\u201d has been held to help people unite to join and consume waste products, which some claim can kill the corona virus, alongside cow dung. It is not clear whether social distance guidelines are maintained during parties. \u201cWe have been drinking cow urine for 21 years, we also bathe in cow dung. We have never felt the need to consume British medicines,\u201d party participant Om Prakash told Reuters. A representative from India\u2019s conservative nationalist party, Bharatiya Janata Party was arrested after he organized a party last month when the country began imposing restrictions on major meetings after the pandemic. He was arrested after an observer claimed to be forced to drink urine, which resulted in a trip to the hospital due to nausea and vomiting. The party leadership vigorously defended the representative and claimed the arrest was an insult to democracy soon afterwards. \u201cWhen he distributed it, he clearly said it was cow urine, he did not force anyone to drink it,\u201d a party leader told the Indian news agency PTI. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been proven whether it is dangerous or not. So how can the police arrest him for no reason? This is totally undemocratic.\u201d Cow urine is falsely claimed to be effective in treating COVID-19, along with a number of other diseases and diseases. Pavel Sipachev / Getty Drinking any animal urine is not safe or effective for treating COVID-19 or other diseases. There is no reputable evidence that shows that drinking any liquid is effective against viruses, although several other substances have also been suggested. In Kenya, Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko promotes cognac drinks that are arguably more delicious, urging that the Hennessy brand cognac be distributed with food distributed to those in need. The recommendation was reported based on false claims that the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended drinking alcohol to ward off the virus. Consuming alcohol has no effect on pathogens and can reduce the body\u2019s natural ability to fight infection, according to WHO. Hennessy warned Kenya not to believe that drinking their products would prevent or treat COVID-19. Other substances recommended by leaders around the world for consumption to treat this virus include lemongrass, garlic, paprika and onion tea. Do not consume anything by fasting also touted as a potential remedy for this disease. A Brazilian congressman who also serves as a conservative Pentecostal preacher claims that one day of fasting and prayer will produce a \u201cmiracle\u201d that will see the virus eradicated from the country. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who regards the virus as \u201ca little cold,\u201d agrees that such a day would \u201cfree Brazil from this crime.\u201d Newsweek reached out to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and WHO to provide comments but no one responded in time to publication.

It was not a medicine or herbal concoction being served in the clay cups, but cow urine. After consuming a glass of cow urine at the 'gaumutra party' held here on Saturday, Swami Chakrapani, who claims to be president of the Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha that organised the event at its premises here, claimed that coronavirus is an \"avatar\" that has come to punish those who eat non-vegetarian food. Punjab govt shuts down cinema halls, bans public gatherings due to coronavirus scare Asking for forgiveness from the virus on behalf of meat eaters, he pledged that Indians will never eat meat again. \"Coronavirus has come because of the people who kill and eat animals. When you kill an animal, it creates a sort of energy that causes destruction in that place. This is the reason why it is spreading in the entire world,\" he claimed. His comments came even as the central government has asked people not to pay attention to \"false rumours\" that the novel coronavirus was spreading through non-vegetarian food like eggs, chicken, mutton and seafood. Union Fisheries, Dairying and Animal Husbandry Minister Giriraj Singh told reporters on March 6 the World Organisation for Animal Health as well as Indian food safety regulator FSSAI have said there was no scientific evidence to prove transmission of coronavirus from animals to humans. \"The false rumour has hit thousands of farmers engaged in this business. The livelihood of farmers and the people engaged in the entire value chain have been affected. I humbly request people not to fall prey to such rumours,\" the minister had said. While medical practitioners across the world have said there is no cure as such for coronavirus, Chakrapani claimed that cow urine is the \"only cure\" for COVID-19 and requested global leaders to consume the \"miracle liquid\" and lead by example in the fight against the contagious viral disease. \"All our leaders and officials consume 'gaumutra'. But they do so behind closed doors and when they are sick. It doesn't work like that,\" he said, insisting that cow urine should be consumed on a daily basis to keep diseases at bay. Coronavirus: Number of positive cases rise to 84, says Health ministry \"They (leaders) are ashamed of the gift gods have given us. Cow urine is pure elixir. Every person should drink it.\" The event began with a 'yagna' and prayers to the cow and the virus itself, asking it to leave peacefully and not kill any more people. A large poster in the backdrop depicted an avatar of Hindu god Narsingh as coronavirus. Chakrapani emphasised that global leaders should import 'gau mutra' from India as the cow giving the \"miracle elixir\" must be of an Indian breed only. \"They (global leaders) should get cow urine imported from India because the almighty resides only in the Indian cow and not in any foreign breed,\" the Mahasabha chief said. \"I request all the presidents and prime ministers of the world to take cow urine on a daily basis. You have all these scientists who don't know the cure, we have the cure given to us by the gods,\" he claimed. Kriti Bhushan, former DG of Directorate General of Health Services, told PTI there is no scientific evidence behind claims that cow urine can cure coronavirus. \"In medical science, we only call something a cure after testing it on a 100 people or more. This is a unilateral claim and has no basis to it. In fact, currently there's no cure available for coronavirus. A lot of scientists are continuously working to find a solution,\" he said. Rajesh Sharma, a volunteer at the event, vouched for its \"miraculous\" properties while offering the drink to others around him. \"You have just one glass today and by tomorrow morning you will know the difference.Gaumutra can cure all diseases, I can give it to you in writing,\" Sharma claimed. Savita, a housewife from Paschim Vihar, came all the way to attend the 'gaumutra party'. \"I drink gaumutra on a daily basis, there is nothing healthier than this. Everyone in my family drinks it,\" she said while sipping from a glass full of cow urine.

Cassell New Share on Pinterest Experts say COVID-19 is two to three times more contagious than flu, so the virus can spread rapidly from person to person from gatherings. Getty Images Experts are noting examples across the country of how one social gathering such as a choir practice or a funeral can quickly spread COVID-19. They note the illness caused by the novel coronavirus appears to be two to three times more contagious than the flu. They add that early research indicates that people with COVID-19 may transmit the virus to two or three people before symptoms appear and they go into self-isolation. The experts say this high infection rate is why social distancing and other preventive measures are important. All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 outbreak. In Skagit County, Washington, 45 members of a 60-person choir rehearsal became ill with COVID-19. None had shown symptoms prior to attending rehearsal and there were no known cases in their county, despite people contracting the novel coronavirus in nearby Seattle. In Austin, Texas, 28 out of 70 students who booked a plane to Mexico for a spring break trip have tested positive for the virus. Meanwhile, a town in Georgia where more than 200 mourners gathered to attend a funeral has become a viral hotspot, with dozens of relatives and attendees falling ill. And a radio host who was covering the coronavirus quarantine in New Rochelle, New York, in early March hosted a 90th birthday party for her mother on March 8. She later tested positive for COVID-19. Since then, eight people who attended the party have come down with the illness, including both her parents. Two of the infected party attendees have died. Each of these \u2014 and many other similar cases \u2014 highlights just how quickly COVID-19 can spread from even a relatively small gathering of people. It also indicates how a case-free area can quickly become a viral epicenter. Current recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) call for canceling gatherings of more than 250 people in places without any reported cases and canceling events of any size where there\u2019s substantial community spread of the disease. Coming to a community near you These cases underline that canceling events, staying at home, and practicing social distancing might be the only way to prevent or limit a sudden surge of COVID-19, even if it\u2019s not widespread in a community. For instance, while many places in the United States, especially rural areas, have yet to experience a confirmed case of COVID-19, it\u2019s unlikely any community will escape the spread of the illness, experts say. Relatively isolated communities are often not self-sufficient and that means they still receive supplies and contact from the outside world, said Eleanor J. Murray, ScD, assistant professor of epidemiology at Boston University in Massachusetts and co-host of the Casual Inference podcast. In the absence of extensive and rigorous testing, that means the virus reaching these places is inevitable. \u201cRural and remote communities may be protected in the short term because of the limited contact between them and other areas. However, we know from past outbreaks (including 1918 influenza, HIV, etc.) that widespread infectious diseases do reach remote and rural areas,\u201d Murray told Healthline. \u201cWhen they do, these areas often suffer disproportionate death rates because of a lack of easy access to care, and interdependency among community members for essential services. For example, if an area has one doctor and she gets sick, that\u2019s a very big deal.\u201d Why the virus is so contagious Right now, we don\u2019t know exactly how contagious COVID-19 is compared to other illnesses, but it appears to be around two or three times as contagious as the flu, according to Tista Ghosh, MD, MPH, medical director at healthcare company Grand Rounds and a former member of the CDC\u2019s Community Preventive Services Task Force. In fact, a group of experts has reportedly told Trump administration officials that talking and even breathing could spread the disease. \u201cEpidemiologists use the term R0 (R \u201cnaught\u201d) to explain how contagious a virus is,\u201d Ghosh told Healthline. \u201cIf a virus has an R0 of 1, that means each person [with the infection] can spread the disease to one other person. We\u2019re still learning about the R0 of this new coronavirus, but some studies have suggested an R0 between 2 to 2.5 \u2014 meaning for every person [with the disease], approximately \u2018two-ish\u2019 people will contract the virus.\u201d Other studies put that number higher, closer to 3 or 3.5, she noted. \u201cNow let\u2019s imagine that the first person [with the virus] stays at home and doesn\u2019t interact with anyone. Then the virus doesn\u2019t have the opportunity to [transmit to] three more people. Those three people don\u2019t have the opportunity to [affect] nine more people,\u201d Ghosh explained. \u201cSo social distancing (staying away from each other) interrupts the virus\u2019s ability to spread and infect.\u201d \u201cRight now, it\u2019s the only tool we have to stop this spread because we don\u2019t have a vaccine,\u201d she noted. That\u2019s a big deal when a viable vaccine is likely more than a year away. The CDC recommends that all people wear cloth face masks in public places where it\u2019s difficult to maintain a 6-foot distance from others. This will help slow the spread of the virus from people without symptoms or people who do not know they have contracted the virus. Cloth face masks should be worn while continuing to practice physical distancing. Instructions for making masks at home can be found here. Note: It\u2019s critical to reserve surgical masks and N95 respirators for healthcare workers. Governments begin cracking down\u00a0 People either unable or unwilling to ignore those social distancing rules put themselves at considerable risk. A new interactive map from the New York Times illustrates the spread of the disease when people began to stop traveling more than a couple of miles. In places such as Florida and Louisiana, several pastors have continued to hold large congregations. Local governments have been cracking down on such events. The pastor of the Life Tabernacle Church in Central, Louisiana, who has been defying Governor John Bel Edwards\u2019 orders to end mass gatherings, was recently charged with six misdemeanors violations for continuing to hold services. \u201cThis is not an issue over religious liberty and it\u2019s not about politics,\u201d Central Police Department Chief Roger Corcoran told local TV station WAFB. \u201cWe are facing a public health crisis and expect our community\u2019s leaders to set a positive example and follow the law.\u201d A Tampa, Florida, pastor was arrested this week for similar reasons and charged with unlawful assembly and violation of public health emergency rules. Experts say these measures are necessary to preserve public health and curtail preventable deaths from the virus. \u201cWe know that when people cough or sneeze, or when they sing or talk loudly, they produce little particles that can travel about 6 feet (or 2 meters) and can land on people or surfaces,\u201d Murray explained. \u201cThese particles can be infectious for hours or days depending on where they land, and if someone touches them and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth, they can [contract the virus].\u201d \u201cLarge church services are a bad idea because it\u2019s very unlikely that people will all be more than 6 feet apart and that no one will come into physical contact,\u201d she added. \u201cChoir practices and other singing events should be canceled because even being 6 feet apart might not be far enough.\u201d Testing, distancing, and isolation Reports have surfaced this week that 25 to 50 percent of people with COVID-19 don\u2019t have noticeable symptoms and could be unknowingly spreading the virus to others. \u201cAs long as there are asymptomatic people wandering around, transmission to others will continue to occur,\u201d Michael G. Schmidt, PhD, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in Charleston, South Carolina, told Healthline. One way to limit transmission of the virus from those who are asymptomatic would be rigorous testing of the entire population, a capacity the United States has not yet accomplished. \u201c[With SARS], the thing that really helped with that was really testing and tracking and contact tracing to identify who is sick, who has been exposed to them, who needs to be locked down. And in the U.S., even once we knew that we had cases [of COVID-19], we weren\u2019t doing that because we didn\u2019t have the testing capability,\u201d Murray said. \u201cAnd so, without being able to test people, we couldn\u2019t lock down people who might be infected or infectious and everything kind of proceeded as normal. Given the testing situation, I think it would have been appropriate to say all mass gatherings should be canceled because we have no idea whether COVID is here or in what quantity.\u201d That makes self-quarantine if you\u2019re sick, self-isolation if you have come in contact with someone who is sick, and social distancing if you\u2019re otherwise healthy all the more important, she said. We\u2019ll likely have to continue to do this in some measure or another until a vaccine is developed. \u201cAs soon as you stop these social distancing type things you run the risk of starting up a whole new chain of infection,\u201d she said.

Jonathan Fuller, The Conversation An hour ago Representational image. | Joe Klamar/AFP An hour ago Jonathan Fuller, The Conversation Share Tweet Email Reddit Print Comments Share Tweet Email Reddit Print Comments When people fall seriously ill from the new coronavirus, death rates become a highly personal matter. Yet we talk about them in the most impersonal of ways: with numbers. We are told, for instance, that the case-fatality ratio from Covid-19 is 1%-2% \u2013 or is it 0.66%, or 3.28%? And that there could be 100,000 to 240,000 Covid-19 deaths in the United States by mid-June, or perhaps far fewer. I trained in medicine and now work as a philosopher of science. Over the past several years, I\u2019ve been trying to understand how epidemiological evidence influences thinking in health care. Epidemiological data are critical in deciding public health action, such as when to ease up on social distancing. But how should we think about the ever-shifting Covid-19 statistics as individuals and as public health decision-makers? Answering this question requires diving deeper into the meaning of the numbers. What it all means Epidemiological numbers like infection rates and death counts have been a grim presence in this pandemic, represented by circular tumors growing outward on maps. The case-fatality ratio is the proportion of deaths from Covid-19 among those infected. In the three weeks leading up to April 7, the United States counted 11,014 Covid-19 deaths and 368,909 confirmed cases, for a case-fatality ratio of 11,014/368,909 = 3.0%. As individuals, we have a psychological and practical need to make sense of population figures for individual lives. However, it is a mistake to conclude that your individual risk of death would be 3.0% if you were to contract Covid-19. The factors that make one vulnerable to death from Covid-19 are distributed unevenly in the population. They are greatly underrepresented in the very young, for example, and greatly overrepresented in the very old. The case-fatality ratio \u2013 like all epidemiological numbers \u2013 is a measure of a population, not an individual. Epidemiological numbers should inform your beliefs about your future but probably don\u2019t reveal your \u201cindividual risk.\u201d Epidemiological numbers are also relative to a particular population at a particular point in time. It was recently reported in the media that a new study showed that the infection-fatality ratio for Covid-19 is 0.66%, not the 2% previously quoted. But 0.66% is the estimate for the population of China. The same study estimated the ratio in China\u2019s population under age 60 to be 0.145%, and 3.28% in China\u2019s population over 60. The case-fatality ratio, like all epidemiologic figures, is neither a property of the individual nor the virus. It emerges from the interaction among a particular population, pathogen and place. Hypothetical futures At a somber press briefing at the end of March, the White House coronavirus team said statistical modeling had projected that there would be between 100,000 and 240,000 Covid-19 deaths in the United States through mid-June. That\u2019s with the current mitigation efforts in place through April 30, including policies to promote social distancing. The estimate was based on the results of several statistical models produced around the world, and it inherits the uncertainty of those results. In deciding how to slow the spread of the new coronavirus, including when to ease up on social distancing, forecasters must compare hypothetical futures. Imagine what would happen in the future if social distancing measures had never been implemented. According to models cited by the White House, 1,500,000-2,200,000 people would die from Covid-19 in the US. The estimate of 100,000-240,000 Covid-19 deaths occurs in a very different hypothetical future, one in which social distancing is maintained for a few more weeks. Another model, which assumes all states use social distancing measures until June, has a lower projection of around 60,000 Covid-19 deaths by August. Dr Anthony Fauci, who serves on the White House coronavirus task force, said Thursday that he now believes the toll will be closer to that lower number. Statistical models project how interventions might lower the death toll from pandemics. Credit: Centres for Disease Control and Prevention How effective will our current interventions be at saving lives? To answer that question, we compare hypothetical futures and calculate the difference in number of deaths. The answer changes depending on which futures are compared. For example, if we compare the two futures presented by the White House, between 1,260,000 and 2,100,000 lives will be saved in the US by preventing Covid-19 infections. Those numbers are why we should stay home for now and continue social distancing. To determine when to let up on social distancing, one must similarly compare hypothetical futures. But we also must consider what else will be going on in these hypothetical worlds. Will public health surveillance and contact tracing be scaled up? Will everyone be wearing face masks in public? The answers to these further questions will determine what will happen when social distancing measures are relaxed. As the number of modifiable variables rises, so does the number of hypothetical futures to contemplate. Which numbers matter In comparing deaths, outbreak modeling typically focuses only on those deaths that result from the direct physiological effects of the pathogen. However, there are other deaths to consider, due to other effects of the virus and our interventions. A steep, unchecked rise in infections would overwhelm the health system, risking further deaths not only among patients with Covid-19 but also among other sick people who need health care. Prolonged social distancing has economic implications, as does an uncontrolled outbreak or a secondary outbreak that might occur if social distancing measures are lifted in the wrong circumstances. An economic downturn, including job losses, has far-reaching and sometimes surprising effects on health and survival. Another important caveat is that the effects of our interventions, like all epidemiological numbers, also depend on population and place. When comparing higher-income countries with lower-income countries, distributions of age and diseases and patterns of social interaction and health care resources often differ substantially, which can influence the effects of Covid-19 interventions like social distancing policies. Their effectiveness can\u2019t be simply extrapolated from one context to another. Ultimately, deciding which effects of our interventions to measure and how to measure them is not a purely scientific problem; it is also an ethical problem. Summing deaths assigns moral worth to life and treats all lives equally. Counting life-years lost and effects on quality of life assumes that how much life is lived and how it is lived also matters. Some effects are more difficult to quantify or predict but must not be ignored, especially when we have the ability to offset them with further action. We must think more broadly than an outbreak model thinks. In a pandemic, numbers can tell us a lot. They speak more to us the more deeply we understand them.

In addition to the already established methods like social distancing, frequent hand washing, and the importance of complying with local \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as local health experts, are recommending that local residents wear face coverings when leaving their homes for necessary trips. According to information from the CDC, cloth face coverings should be worn in public settings where social distancing methods may be difficult to maintain, such as the grocery store or the pharmacy. According to the CDC, face coverings can be made from low-cost materials, or even items found around the home and should have the following characteristics: \u2022 Fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face \u2022 Be secured with ties or ear loops \u2022 Include multiple layers of fabric \u2022 Allow for breathing without restriction \u2022 Be able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape Since one of the methods Coronavirus can spread is via respiratory droplets expelled from an infected person, face coverings can help keep healthy individuals from being exposed to those particles, or prevent those who may be infected with COVID-19 but not showing symptoms from unwittingly spreading the virus, said Dr. Christopher Romero, internal medicine specialist and physician adviser at Valley Baptist Medical Center-Harlingen. \u201cBecause social distancing can be difficult in settings such as the grocery store, cloth face coverings can help slow or prevent the transmission of COVID-19 from person to person,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile the best protection is still complying with local shelter in place orders and leaving your home only when absolutely necessary, wearing a face covering when doing so is a good way to protect yourself.\u201d While the CDC does recommend the use of face coverings when leaving your home, local residents do not need to purchase professional grade protective equipment such as N95 or surgical masks. Such equipment should be reserved for healthcare providers, Romero said. In addition to new guidelines regarding face coverings, social distancing remains one of the best ways to protect against the virus. The concept of social distancing encourages maintaining a space of six feet between individuals whenever possible. Romero said that as healthcare providers continue to assess and adapt to the COVID-19 situation, the community can play a major role in those efforts by practicing simple activities such like social distancing. \u201cFor now we do not have an FDA-approved medication to treat COVID-19 or a vaccine to prevent the infection in the first place,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil we have those tools to combat this virus, prevention is the best thing we can do to protect ourselves and our community.\u201d Romero said that things like hand washing, limiting travel, staying away from others when you are sick, and social distancing can help protect the vulnerable members of our community, including the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. \u201cMany people who become infected with COVID-19 may not even know they are spreading the virus before they develop symptoms, or may experience mild symptoms that they believe are a more minor infection,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are not careful and take appropriate precautions such as social distancing and frequent hand washing, they may spread the infection to those who can develop more serious infections, or even die from COVID-19.\u201d Although social distancing is a means to combat exposure to Coronavirus, Romero warned against gathering in large groups, even if distance between individuals is maintained since the virus can be spread through means other than respiratory exposure. \u201cWhile social distancing certainly reduces the spread of infection, it does not eliminate it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe virus is also spread by exposure to contaminated objects that others may touch as well, such as door knobs, sink handles, utensils, and many other common surfaces. Now that COVID-19 has been identified in our community, it is up to all of us to do everything we can to reduce its spread, including postponing social gatherings.\u201d When unable to practice effective social distancing, such as when venturing to the grocery store, Romero said there are steps you can take to protect yourself from COVID-19. \u201cThis is where washing your hands frequently comes into play,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, use sanitation wipes on shared items such as shopping carts when available, and avoid touching your face.\u201d While measures such as social distancing and shelter in place notices from county officials may seem like over-reactions, Romero said such steps are necessary and vital to help end the COVID-19 situation as soon as possible. \u201cIn this challenging time, it\u2019s important for us all to not only be concerned about our well-being, but for the well-being of those in our community who are most vulnerable,\u201d He said. \u201cIf you are young and healthy you may feel invincible to threats like COVID-19. But even young people can get dangerously ill, and also act as carriers and spread the infection to others. None of us should feel shy about telling others to stay away or not visit us if they are sick. The more we reduce the spread of COVID-19, the sooner this pandemic will be over for all of us.\u201d More Information \u2022 As recommended by the CDC and local health officials, individuals should wear a cloth face covering if they need to leave their home for essential travel. \u2022 Stay home if you have a cold to prevent the spread of infection. \u2022 Washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use alcohol based hand sanitizer. \u2022 Avoid touching your face. \u2022 Keep six feet away from people who are potentially sick. \u2022 Contact your physician and seek medical care if you are having trouble breathing, confusion, or high fever. \u2022 If you will be seeking medical care for symptoms that you think may be from COVID-19, please call ahead to notify your physician so that they may be ready for your arrival. \u2022 For more information, visit the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention website (www.CDC.gov), as well as the Cameron County Public Health Department website (www.cameroncounty.us/publichealth/ More about Coronavirus Rural Indiana virus worry: \u2018What more could I have done?'

As the outbreak progresses, everyone from lawmakers to the general public is encouraged to start practicing social distancing \u2014 the limiting of social contact in an effort to lessen the spread of the virus by person to person transmission. So far, a number of people seem resistant to the idea of social distancing \u2014 just look at the early celebrations of Saint Patrick\u2019s Day that occurred this past weekend. However, it is imperative that people, including college students now free from the constraints of the classroom, are serious about adopting the practice of social distancing. It really is the least we can do to help limit the spread of the coronavirus. The goal of social distancing is to limit contact between people by altering one\u2019s behavior. Avoiding large gatherings and choosing to work from home are both examples of practicing social distancing. A common misconception seems to be that social distancing is the same as isolation or quarantine. In reality, these are two additional measures of preventing the spread of COVID-19, and they are more extreme than social distancing, as they enforce restrictions on location and movement. As the COVID-19 outbreak has evolved into a pandemic, the CDC continues to emphasize the importance of avoiding contact with sick people, and it lists putting distance between oneself and others as an effective way of preventing transmission. We know that the idea of social distancing is not ideal, especially considering that college students have been on spring break and haven\u2019t seen some of our friends in a week or more. A good number of students also traveled, both abroad and domestically, over break, possibly putting them at a higher risk of exposure to COVID-19. As such, it\u2019s important that students do their best to implement social distancing. Students whose universities have shut down in-person instruction like Pitt already have a head start on social distancing. Limiting exposure to large gatherings \u2014 think of a 200-person lecture or even just groups of students studying in close proximity in a library \u2014 is one element to social distancing. However, universities have already done their part by calling off classes and encouraging students to stay off campus. Now, the responsibility falls on students. With Saint Patrick\u2019s Day coming up on Tuesday, students might be tempted to go out to parties, despite the fact that this would mean that they disregard the criteria for social distancing. At this point, it is imperative that students consider the possible consequences of their choosing to ignore the widespread recommendation to maintain social distance. Creating and maintaining social distance will help \u201cflatten the curve\u201d of the COVID-19 outbreak, thus keeping the number of cases at a level that health care providers can manage and ensuring better care for any infected people. By complying with social distancing guidelines, college students \u2014 as well as the rest of the population \u2014 can do their part in slowing the spread of the pandemic.

Image Credit: ANI Prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary even until 2022 to prevent future Covid-19 seasonal outbreaks, a new study has said. Researchers from Harvard University, led by Stephen Kissler, used estimates of seasonality, immunity, and cross-immunity for two betacoronaviruses from time series data from the United States, to inform a model of Covid-19 transmission, Xinhua news agency reported. Recurrent wintertime outbreaks of Covid-19 \"will probably occur after the initial, most severe pandemic wave,\" researchers wrote on in the study 'Projecting the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 through the postpandemic period', published in the online journal Science. The researchers added that without a vaccine or other interventions, \"prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022.\" Noting that \"a key metric for the success of social distancing is whether critical care capacities are exceeded,\" the study said that \"additional interventions, including expanded critical care capacity and an effective therapeutic, would improve the success of intermittent distancing and hasten the acquisition of herd immunity.\" Longitudinal serological studies are urgently needed to determine the extent and duration of immunity to the virus, the researchers said. Even in the event of apparent elimination, Covid-19 surveillance should be maintained since a resurgence in contagion could be possible as late as 2024, according to the study. The number of people infected with the new coronavirus worldwide has surpassed 1.8 million with 71,779 cases verified over the past 24 hours, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday. According to the update, the global count of confirmed COVID-19 cases has reached 1,844,863, with the majority of them concentrated in Europe (943,272) and the Americas (644,986). The death toll has grown by 5,369 cases over the past day to a total of 117,021 fatalities, the report read.

By Celia Shortt Goodyear Boulder City Review April 1, 2020 - 3:09 pm \u00a0 Boulder City Boulder City firefighter and paramedics Josh Barrone, left, and Jay Dardano demonstrate the proper distance for social distancing. Robert A.J. Signer and Gary Warshaw Following social distancing protocols is the way to stop the spread of COVID-19 and the global pandemic, according to medical researchers and health officials. \u201cExecuting it (social distancing) effectively can protect people from the spread of the virus. \u2026 When we social distance enough \u2026 in many cases, the pandemic stops,\u201d said Robert A. J. Signer in an interview with the Boulder City Review. Signer is an assistant professor of medicine at the University of California, San Diego. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 is spread mainly through person-to-person contact. Social distancing is increasing the space between individuals and decreasing contact to reduce the spread of the disease. The CDC recommends keeping 6 feet between individuals, even those who do not have any symptoms. Recently, Signer and his art director, Gary Warshaw, created a graphic to demonstrate how social distancing can help stop the spread of COVID-19. Signer said with the current data, he estimated the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 to be 2.5, meaning that each infected person will transmit the virus to an average of 2.5 other people. \u201cIf each infected person transmits the virus to 2.5 other people over five days while they are asymptomatic, then a single infected person can become 406 infected people in just 30 days,\u201d he said. Signer said if people reduce physical contact by 50 percent, then only 15 people will become infected in 30 days. If physical contact is reduced by 75 percent, then only 2.5 people will become infected over 30 days. \u201cAt this level of social distancing, new infections will approach zero. \u2026 This isn\u2019t a small difference,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a big difference.\u201d Boulder City firefighter and paramedic Jay Dardano said 6 feet between people equals about two arms lengths. Dardano said that distance is important because droplets containing the coronavirus from people\u2019s sneezes and coughs will start to drop toward the ground rather than landing on another person. Symptoms of COVID-19, which are similar to the flu, are a fever, cough and shortness of breath. They can appear between two and 14 days after exposure. As of 9 a.m. Tuesday, there have been 1,113 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nevada and 17 deaths. More information can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov.

Their study titled, \u201cA Trial of Lopinavir\u2013Ritonavir in Adults Hospitalized with Severe COVID-19,\u201d was published in the latest issue of the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). What was the study about? Novel coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan, China, in the Hubei Province in December 2019. The virus called SARS-CoV-2, since then, has wreaked havoc around the world, with a total of 242,191 confirmed cases as of now and 9,843 deaths across the globe. On 11th March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the respiratory disease - COVID-19, caused by the coronavirus infection as a pandemic meaning multiple nations are at risk from this virus. In most individuals, there may be a self-limiting infection and illness of the respiratory tract. In some individuals, however, the problem may intensify to lead to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death. The elderly and those with immunocompromised states are more at risk, say the researchers. SARS-CoV-2 - Transmission electron micrograph of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles, isolated from a patient. Image captured and color-enhanced at the NIAID Integrated Research Facility (IRF) in Fort Detrick, Maryland. Credit: NIAID Despite the magnitude of the problem, there are no specific antiviral drugs to treat the condition. An earlier version of coronavirus caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) back in 2003, for which lopinavir, a drug used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), was used. Studies have suggested that lopinavir might be useful against novel coronavirus because it showed efficacy against both SARS and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus). To increase the duration of action of the drug, lopinavir could be combined with another drug used in HIV called ritonavir, explained the researchers. The study This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of orally administered lopinavir-ritonavir for SARS-CoV-2 infection among adults who have been admitted to the hospital with severe Covid-19. The trial is called \u201cLOTUS China (Lopinavir Trial for Suppression of SARS-Cov-2 in China)\u201d. Related Stories Potential targets for immune responses to novel coronavirus identified Researchers discover human protein that potently inhibits coronavirus A grim coronavirus situation in Italy This was a randomized controlled trial that included patients with severe Covid-19 who had an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94 percent or less between 18th January and 3rd February 2020. They were admitted at Jin Yin-Tan Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The patients were divided into two groups randomly, and one group received 400 mg and 100 mg, respectively of Lopinavir and Ritonavir twice daily for 14 days, along with standard supportive care. All medications were provided freely by the national health authority. The other group received standard care alone. Standard care meant, \u201cas necessary, supplemental oxygen, noninvasive and invasive ventilation, antibiotic agents, vasopressor support, renal-replacement therapy, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO),\u201d wrote the researchers. What was found? For the study, the team of researchers recruited a total of 199 patients in whom the SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed. The population was 60.3 percent male, and the average age of the study population was 58 years. Of these, 99 were administered the drug combination while 100 received standard care. Results showed as follows; Time to clinical improvement was similar with both the treatment approaches The percentage of clinical improvement at day 14 for those on lopinavir and ritonavir was 45.5 percent compared to those on standard care (30 percent). Risk of death at 28 days was similar with both treatment approaches Viral load was tested at various time points, and the results from both groups were similar Clinical time to improvement of symptoms was one day shorter than standard care alone on an average, the results revealed Need for glucocorticoids or steroids were in 33 percent of patients on lopinavir and ritonavir and among 35.7 percent of those receiving standard care. Those on lopinavir and ritonavir had a shorter stay in the intensive care unit compared to those on standard care (6 days compared to 11 days). Serious adverse effects were more common in those receiving standard care, but gastrointestinal side effects were more common with lopinavir and ritonavir. These adverse effects among those on lopinavir and ritonavir were severe enough for 13 patients to discontinue treatment. Implications and future directions The researchers concluded that orally given lopinavir and ritonavir did not provide significant benefit in patients admitted with severe COVID-19. They wrote, \u201cFuture trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.\u201d This project was supported by the Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development, among others.

Below are some of the prime research and developments on the Covid-19 front. Examine reveals lopinavir-ritonavir combo & Arbidol ineffective\u00a0 A examine on the safety and efficacy of possibly HIV drug combination lopinavir-ritonavir or influenza drug Arbidol as solutions for Covid-19 has observed that neither enhances the medical outcome of clients hospitalised with moderate-to-moderate conditions of the ailment. Lopinavir-ritonavir mixture and Arbidol had been picked as candidates for dealing with Covid-19 in a steering issued on 19 February by the National Health Commission of China, based mostly on in-vitro mobile exams and preceding medical knowledge from SARS and MERS, the researchers, from Guangzhou Eighth People\u2019s Medical center in China, said. However, the review has revealed that neither of the antivirals gain medical results of people. The study assessed 86 sufferers with delicate-to-reasonable Covid-19, with 34 randomly assigned to obtain lopinavir-ritonavir, 35 to Arbidol, and 17 with no antiviral treatment as a handle. All a few teams confirmed identical outcomes at 7 and 14 days, with no variations among teams in the fees of fever reduction, cough alleviation, or enhancement of chest CT scan. The study also discovered that the medicines can induce aspect consequences. Patients in both equally drug teams experienced adverse occasions these as diarrhea, nausea, and decline of hunger through the abide by-up period, although no apparent adverse function happened in the management team. Also go through: India\u2019s Covid-19 R0 down to 1.36 now, 25,000 conditions by April-finish at this charge: IMS scientist Plastic cover can guard health care employees from Covid-19 Researchers have designed a uncomplicated cost-effective plastic canopy process that can assistance shield health care workers from contracting coronavirus an infection when delivering non-invasive air flow or oxygen guidance to sufferers. Non-invasive air flow is normally used to deal with people with respiratory failure, a symptom of severe coronavirus disease, as it helps them breathe by pushing pressured air into the lungs through a mask covering the mouth and/or nose. Even though this can reduce the will need for mechanical ventilators utilized in critical treatment, there are issues about the increased hazard of an infection for healthcare employees who deal with clients with non-invasive respiratory support. In a analyze printed in the European Respiratory Journal, scientists have explained a \u201cconstant circulation cover system\u201d that is built to cut down publicity to the virus for health care staff. The plastic cover kinds an air chamber that covers the higher component of the patient\u2019s body. The cover is linked to a method containing a filter for cleansing air, and an electrical fan that pulls away this filtered air. The cover method can be used on at the very least 4 patients at a time. The plastic made use of for the canopy structure does not permit fluid or particles to go through it, the scientists claimed. Also examine: Journalist Gulshan Ewing, former editor of Eve\u2019s Weekly, dies of Covid-19 in Uk at 92 New biosensor can test for SARS-CoV-2 in a moment Scientists from South Korea have formulated a biosensor that detects SARS-CoV-2 from nasal and throat swabs in significantly less than a moment. Currently, Covid-19 assessments use a procedure known as serious-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain response (RT-PCR), which amplifies SARS-CoV-2 RNA from patient swabs so that tiny amounts of the virus can be detected. Even so, it takes numerous hours to get ready the samples for these tests. To remove the sample preparing methods, the staff dependent their examination on a subject-result transistor \u2014 a sheet of graphene with significant conductivity. They attached antibodies versus the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the graphene. When SARS-CoV-2 is additional to the sensor, it binds to the antibody and results in a adjust in the electrical existing. The group analyzed the method on nasopharyngeal swabs gathered from patients with Covid-19 or healthier controls. While the check was about 2-4 moments considerably less sensitive than RT-PCR, distinct components can be explored to increase the exams, the scientists explained. Very poor air high quality joined to extra Covid-19 fatalities Areas that have higher concentrations of nitrogen dioxide in the air observed additional variety of fatalities from Covid-19, a research has uncovered. The scientists from Martin Luther College Halle-Wittenberg (MLU) in Germany, presents facts to again the assumption that weak air quality produced populations additional vulnerable to the coronavirus. The workforce blended satellite details on air air pollution and air currents with confirmed deaths related to Covid-19. They discovered that regions with completely high amounts of air pollution \u2014 Northern Italy, the spot about Madrid, and Hubei Provence in China \u2014 have appreciably a lot more fatalities than other regions. The staff stated that these 3 areas are surrounded by mountains, which lowers the air circulation in these locations \u2014 and cause air pollutants to accumulate. Persistent air air pollution in these influenced areas could have led to general poorer wellbeing in the men and women living there, producing them specifically inclined to the virus. The results ended up published in the journal Science of the Full Environment. Also browse: How Singapore flipped from virus hero to cautionary tale \u00a0 ThePrint is now on Telegram.

By: Jahnavi Sarma \u00a0 | | Updated: April 6, 2020 10:41 am Tags: Coronavirus\u00a0\u00a0coronavirus outbreak\u00a0\u00a0 According to the Ministry of Health, there are now 4067 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the country. @Shutterstock The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc across the globe. India is in\u00a0complete lockdown with all states and Union Territories taking drastic measures to curtail movement of people in a desperate bid to contain the spread of the disease. Today, as India continues with the 21-day country-wide quarantine where 1.3 billion citizens will stay at home. India is, basically, in self-isolation from the world. With the number of confirmed cases standing at 4067 (including active cases, deaths, cured, discharged and migrated patients) and the death toll being 109, let us look at the latest on the coronavirus front in India\u00a0and abroad. Related Stories Today health tips: Follow safety protocols while ordering a home delivery amidst COVID-19 India lights up to thank coronavirus warriors Minor illnesses can be cured at home amidst COVID-19 lockdown CORONAVIRUS CASES SURGE IN INDIA AND ACROSS THE WORLD According to the latest figures released by the by the Ministry of Health and Welfare on 2nd April, currently, India\u2019s COVID-19 toll is 3666 active cases, 109 deaths, 291 cured/discharged and 1 migrated.\u00a0Active cases exclude deaths, cured, discharged and migrated patients. With India under complete lockdown, health professionals are urging everyone to maintain social distancing and follow the precautionary measures. Elsewhere in the world, the situation is no better with most countries in lockdown mode. There are now 1,136,851 confirmed coronavirus cases around the world and the death toll stands at 62,955, according to the latest updates by the World Health Organization. In the US, the number of\u00a0confirmed coronavirus cases have gone up to 273,808. In the UK, the number of positive cases rose to 41,907 and, in France, the virus has infected 67,757 people so far even as the death rate and cases of new infections in Italy shows a slight fall. Meanwhile, Spain has reported that more than 11,000 fatalities and 124,736 positive cases. According\u00a0 to the National Health Commission, in mainland China, there has been an increase in coronavirus cases with the numbers now reaching 82,930. New cases are mostly imported in the country. There have been reports of more locally transmitted cases in Mainland China. This comes after China reported no new cases for a few days. CORONAVIRUS TESTING IN INDIA India has broadened the testing parametres to include asymptomatic people who fall in the high risk category. Around 12 private labs are now authorised to test for COVID-19 and there are 15,000 collection centres for samples across the country. Of these, 19 labs are in Maharashtra, two each in Haryana and Tamil Nadu and one each in Delhi, Gujarat and Karnataka. The government has also put a cap of RS 4500 on each corona virus test. According to guidelines, this may include Rs 1,500 for a screening test for suspect cases and an additional Rs 3,000 for confirmation test. UPDATE ON THE VACCINE FRONT There is no cure or vaccine for COVID-19. Doctors are isolating patients and treating symptoms. But scientists are racing against time to develop a vaccine at record time. The human trial for one such vaccine has already started in the US. But it will be available in the market only after about a year. China and Europe have also started clinical trials for a vaccine. But the journey of a vaccine from trials to the market is a long one. People need to prepare themselves to wait for more than a year before they get the benefits even as the World Health organisation warns of an accelerating pandemic. Meanwhile, researchers are also investigating the use of the drug\u00a0chloroquine, commonly used in the treatment of malaria,\u00a0lupus and\u00a0rheumatoid arthritis, in coronavirus cases. This drug may be able to reduce the duration of symptoms, as well as viral shedding. This will help prevent the spread of disease. Researchers of a study published in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents say that hydroxychloroquine (Plaqenuil) used in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin (Zithromax or Azithrocin) may reduce coronavirus symptoms. But there have been no definite results as yet and a confirmed treatment may still be a long way off. ON THE LOOK OUT FOR POSSIBLE TREATMENT PROCEDURES With the coronavirus pandemic showing no signs of abating, experts across the world are working against time to develop a cure and a vaccine to the disease. Acknowledging the seriousness of the current situation, the World Health Organisation has fast-tracked the trial of 4 existing treatment procedures as possible cure for the new viral threat. In an unprecedented move, the premier organization has announced a global trial, called SOLIDARITY. WHO is currently focusing on four treatment procedures that may prove useful against the coronavirus. The first is an experimental anti-viral compound called remdesivir. The second is a combination of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, used in malaria treatment. The third is a combination of two HIV drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir. Experts say that these drugs, when used in combination can inhibit coronaviruses. The fourth is a combination of lopinavir, ritonavir and interferon-beta, an immune system messenger that can cripple viruses and regulate inflammation. It showed promise in fighting MERS virus. Meanwhile, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The FDA says that these drugs could be prescribed to teens and adults with COVID-19 \u201cas appropriate, when a clinical trial is not available or feasible\u201d. The statement came after the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) that marked the first EUA for a drug related to COVID-19 in the US, a media report said on Monday. Scientists need to find a cure fast. If they take the normal route, it will probably be years before we see any kind of a cure. So, they have opted for the next best solution \u2013 repurposing drugs already approved for other diseases. These drugs are relatively safe. They are also contemplating unapproved drugs that showed promise during the SARS and MERS outbreaks. Click here for our latest updates on coronavirus.

(Image for representation: PTI) The Union Health Ministry has recommended the use of anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin on those severely suffering from Covid-19 who require ICU management. In its revised guidelines on the 'Clinical Management of Covid-19 issued on Tuesday, the ministry said the drug is presently not recommended for children aged less than 12 and pregnant and lactating women. \"No specific antivirals have been proven to be effective as per currently available data. However, based on the available information (uncontrolled clinical trials), the following drugs may be considered as an off-label indication in patients with severe disease and requiring ICU management,\" the ministry said while recommending the drug combination. The ministry has removed its earlier recommendation of the use of anti-HIV drug combinations Lopinavir and Ritonavir on a case-to-case basis depending upon the severity of the condition of a patient suffering from coronavirus infection. \"As per latest clinical data available from across the work, Lopinavir and Ritonavir drug combination was not found to have significant benefit for patients of COVID-19 so it has been discontinued,\" a health ministry official said. This document is intended for clinicians taking care of hospitalised adult and paediatric patients of COVID-19, the guidelines stated. Best practices for Covid-19 including infection prevention and control (IPC) and optimized supportive care for severely ill patients are considered essential, it said, adding that the document aims to provide clinicians with updated interim guidance on timely, effective and safe supportive management of patients with COVID-19, particularly those who have severe acute respiratory illness and are critically ill. The guidelines issued by the health ministry also state that COVID-19 patients may have mild, moderate, or severe illness -- the latter includes severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock. \"Early identification of those with severe manifestations allows for immediate optimised supportive care treatments and safe, rapid admission (or referral) to intensive care unit according to national protocols,\" the document states. The guidelines advise the treating doctors to closely monitor patients with severe acute respiratory infection for signs of clinical deterioration, such as rapidly progressive respiratory failure and sepsis, and apply supportive care interventions immediately. \"Application of timely, effective, and safe supportive therapies is the cornerstone of therapy for patients who develop severe manifestations of Covid-19,\" it said. \"Understand the patient's co-morbid condition to tailor the management of critical illness and appreciate the prognosis. During intensive care management of severe acute respiratory infection, determine which chronic therapies should be continued and which therapies should be stopped temporarily.\" The guidelines also recommend that the patients and their families must be communicated with pro-actively and provided support and prognostic information. They also recommend to medical practitioners to understand the patient's \"values and preferences\" regarding life-sustaining interventions.

There was no difference in time to clinical improvement among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 treated with lopinavir-ritonavir along with standard care compared to patients receiving only standard care (HR for clinical improvement 1.24, 95% CI 0.90-1.72), reported Bin Cao, MD, of the National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Diseases in Beijing, and colleagues. Both mortality rates at 28 days and the percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA were also similar in both groups, the authors wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine. Some centers and even national guidelines, such as those in Italy, have recommended treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir for patients with COVID-19 infection. Indeed, early reports from doctors in Thailand reported improvements among patients with severe symptoms who were treated with a regimen including the drug, which led to anecdotal reports from China about HIV patients not being able to access the medication due to its demand for treating COVID-19. Cao and colleagues also pointed to an open-label study from 2004 where adding lopinavir-ritonavir to ribavirin reduced risk of adverse clinical outcomes, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or death, and viral load among patients with SARS. \"It's easy to understand that these patients need antivirals, but unfortunately so far there is no solid evidence-based medicine data to show a specific antiviral therapy\" works, said Cao, in a joint China Cardiovascular Association-American College of Cardiology (ACC) webinar. Cao is also leading the CAP China remdesivir 1 trial in mild-to-moderate pneumonia and CAP China remdesivir 2 trial for severe-to-critical pneumonia. In the current study, researchers examined data from hospitalized adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection and an oxygen saturation of 94% or less. Patients were randomized to receive either lopinavir-ritonavir twice a day for 14 days in addition to standard care or standard care (defined as supplemental oxygen, non-invasive and invasive ventilation, antibiotic agents, vasopressor support, renal-replacement therapy, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, as needed). Clinical improvement was defined as time from randomization to an improvement of two points on an ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital. The authors noted this endpoint had previously been used in clinical trials of patients hospitalized with severe influenza. Overall, 199 patients were randomized -- 99 to the lopinavir-ritonavir group, and 100 to standard of care. Median age was 58, and about 60% were men. Median interval time between symptom onset and randomization was 13 days. Systemic glucocorticoids were administered to 33% of patients in the intervention group and 35.7% of patients in the control group. A modified intention-to-treat analysis found lopinavir-ritonavir associated with a median time of clinical improvement shorter by 1 day (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.00-1.91). Interestingly, the intervention group also had a shorter stay in the intensive care unit versus standard care (median 6 vs 11 days, respectively), and duration from randomization to hospital discharge was also shorter. \"What makes lopinavir-ritonavir particularly attractive is that it is widely available and manufacturable to scale and that it could be prescribed immediately,\" noted Lindsey Baden, MD, of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, and Eric Rubin, MD, PhD, of Harvard Chan School of Public Health, in an accompanying editorial. While they called the trial a \"heroic effort,\" it was ultimately \"disappointing.\" Secondary endpoints \"provide both reason for hope and reason for discouragement,\" they added, pointing to the somewhat lower number of deaths with lopinavir-ritonavir but no discernible effect on viral shedding. \"Since the drug is supposed to act as a direct inhibitor of viral replication, the inability to suppress the viral load and the persistent detection of viral nucleic acid strongly suggest that it did not have the activity desired,\" they wrote. The negative results might have been due to selection of a \"particularly challenging\" population late in the course of infection with already considerable tissue damage. \"Even highly active antibacterial agents have limited efficacy in advanced bacterial pneumonia,\" Baden and Rubin pointed out. Also, a number of patients were enrolled before testing for the virus was fully defined. Nevertheless, the trial does have an important lesson, they wrote: \"[I't is clear that rapidly initiated, high-quality randomized clinical trials are possible in epidemic conditions, even in the trying circumstances that prevailed in Wuhan.\" Cao and colleagues found about half of patients in both groups reported adverse events (AEs). While gastrointestinal AEs, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were more common in the intervention group, there were more serious AEs recorded in the standard care group (19 vs 32, respectively). In the standard care group, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and secondary infection were more common. The four serious gastrointestinal AEs in the lopinavir-ritonavir group were judged to be related to the study medication, the authors said. Aside from the open-label design, other limitations included that the intervention group had somewhat higher throat viral loads, which raises \"the possibility that this group had more viral replication,\" the authors said. Use of glucocorticoids may have been another confounder, they added. They concluded that while they found no benefit to lopinavir-ritonavir to treat COVID-19 infection, the effect of combining the drug with other antiviral agents, similar to what was done in SARS and MERS, \"remains to be determined.\" Last Updated March 19, 2020 Disclosures This study was supported by grants from Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Emergency Project of Covid-19, and a National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars.

Menu Avto Entertainment News Sport The cure Covid-19: list of drugs and conditions of their application magictr | April 2, 2020 | News | No Comments In the last two weeks the flow of news about the discovery of drugs for the treatment of coronavirus infection, the early clinical trials of new drugs or even the use of drugs outside the studies (ie, without proven efficiency) is infinitely increased, according Meduza. Photo: shutterstock Much of the discussion was provoked by the statements of the US President Donald trump about an old anti-malarial drug hydroxyquinoline as a substance capable of becoming \u201cone of the greatest discoveries in the history of medicine.\u201d A few days after the statements trump the head of the Federal medico-biological Agency Veronika Skvortsova announced the start of trials in Russia, another anti-malaria substance mefloquine. And on Wednesday, April 1, American management under the control over foodstuff and medicines (FDA) issued a permit for the use of antimalarial drugs outside of clinical trials. First of all, read this short Chapter. Self-medication can be deadly! Before discussing how to treat this news, which is evidence of the effectiveness of these drugs based on what their mechanism of work and other challenging and interesting topics, very important again to say the most mundane things against the backdrop of loud background information is constantly forgotten. On March 31, 2020 there is no specific antiviral drug against COVID-19, the effectiveness of which has been proven in clinical studies and which would be recommended for use by the world health organization (who). Evidence-based medicine requires clinical trials of interventions for safety and effectiveness, and it takes time: depending on the phase of research \u2014 a few months or even a couple of years. The epidemic of coronavirus is actively developing only three months. If a drug, device, or therapy involved in the study, this does not mean that they really work and are safe: study for, and you need to set, like it or not. Clinical studies sometimes fail. More precisely, this: clinical studies often fail than not fail. In a situation when in severe disease there is no specific medications, physicians may use drugs that seem appropriate based on the General concepts of the mechanism of disease development and operation of medicines. Every decision can be a mistake \u2014 but know this will be possible only after conducting full-fledged clinical trials. The vast majority of substances that are discussed in this text, it is impossible to buy in Russia. Therapy (if required) must appoint a physician. Most drugs are poisons. Self-medication can be very dangerous. Trying to \u201cprevent\u201d COVID-19 have already died a few people. Only if we bear all this in mind, you can fully discuss the potential routes of exposure to the virus, its life cycle, differences in the mechanism of the antiviral drugs and other topics that represent purely academic, but not practical interest for the vast majority of readers. What is happening with the therapy COVID-19 \u2014 clinical guidelines In the treatment of patients with coronavirus doctors focus not primarily on scientific publications or the results of clinical trials (although that counts too), and who recommendations and national clinical guidelines. The first temporary recommendations from the Russian Ministry of health released 29 January 2020, they are among the possible antiviral drugs addressed the following substances (read more about them below): ribavirin \u2014 antiviral drug used in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS/SARS; the HIV protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir; and immunomodulator \u2014 interferon is recombinant IFN-\u03b21b. The last (fourth) version of this document (i.e. interim Ministry of health recommendations), updated 27 March, no mention of ribavirin, but considers in addition to the already mentioned anti-malarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, as well as talisman \u2014 a drug based on antibodies. The authors emphasize that there is no objective evidence for the efficacy of all these drugs in COVID-19, therefore, the appointment treatment \u201cmust be accompanied with the receipt of voluntary informed consent of the patient.\u201d Who in their clinical recommendations regarding COVID-19 also recognizes that \u201cnow there is no evidence to recommend any specific treatment\u201d. However, employees of the organization continually monitor experimental therapies and conduct updated list of drugs that are used within the organization \u2014 both within clinical trials and beyond. In addition to the above-mentioned substances and their combinations in this list who also have corticosteroids, other antiretroviral drugs (antiretroviral protease inhibitor darunavir and reverts inhibitors emtricitabine and tenofovir), cytostatics (rukolaine and builtins), immunosuppressants, other types of interferons, antiviral drugs licensed for treatment of influenza (balaclavas, marbocyl, favipiravir, Arbidol/umifenovir) and many other substances. To give a comprehensive description of each of the substances, and even of all groups on the mechanism of action is unlikely to succeed. If you want a deeper dive into the topic in the end of the article there are links where you can study all available public information for all therapeutic options \u2014 and a table of the most large-scale clinical trials. Further we will talk only about the most high-profile drugs, which, on the one hand, who are considered sufficiently promising to be included in an international study \u2014 but on the other hand, has received wide media coverage. This receiver, Kaletra (lopinavir + ritonavir) and, of course, anti-malarial drugs \u2014 chloroquine and its analogues. The Solidarity program under the leadership of who: four kinds of therapy, four drug On March 18 the next meeting of the who on the situation of the coronavirus, the head of the organization Tedros Ghebreyesus announced the start of large-scale international project of clinical research under the name Solidarity (Solidarnost\u2019), in which the infrastructure for the collection of data on clinical trials against COVID-19 in different countries. The idea of the project is to simplify the research: in the collection of information will be able to participate not even the most advanced medical centers under emergency load. Paperwork for registration of patients will be minimized. According to the description, which leads the journal Science, will be sufficient to enter patient information on the who website to inform about the available in hospital drugs and to send an electronic copy of the informed consent. The system then randomly allocate the patient in the experimental group or the placebo group (drugs, of course, needs to be in the hospital \u2014 they who will not bring), and doctors will only report the final results of treatment: time of discharge and the possible need for an artificial lung ventilation (ALV). 18 March it became known that \u201cSolidarity\u201d has been joined by Argentina, Bahrain, Canada, France, Iran, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland and Thailand. Will Russian hospitals to participate in the program, not officially reported. The Ministry of health of Russia at the time of publication of the material did not respond to a request for \u201cMedusa\u201d. It is important to note that the program Soldarity participate in all four therapies: rendezesi chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine lopinavir + ritonavir lopinavir + ritonavir + \u03b2-interferon (IFN-\u03b21b) They considered who the most promising. Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and other anti-malarial drugs What is it? Chloroquine \u2014 similar to the natural substance quinine a synthetic antimalarial drug, discovered in 1934 by German chemist Hans Andersson. Hydroxychloroquine \u2014 a very similar substance, which differs from chloroquine only two atoms (hydroxyl group OH) and approved for medical use by the American FDA in 1955. Mefloquine \u2014 forprostate on the same structural basis as all other quinolines, but significantly different from that of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; developed by the U.S. military in the 1970s, was used as an analogue of quinoline \u2014 after to spread drug resistance. As antimalarial remedies these drugs are quite old, but can still be recommended for use. What is the mechanism of action? All these tools are made to combat malaria, however, around the early 2000s, scientists began to discuss the two side-views of activity: wide anti-virus effect and impact on the immune system. In 2003, in the midst of the SARS outbreak, the Italian scientists led by Roberto Cauda suggested the use of chloroquine to combat coronaviruses and described a possible mechanism of antiviral activity. Briefly, it is that chloroquine penetrates the endosome membrane vesicles, which are formed inside the cells and changes their pH (in malaria there is the same, but with the cells of the parasite \u2014 the malaria parasite). After that, the enzymes that worked in endosome and require a strictly defined level of acidity, are inactivated. Some viruses enter a cell this way, through education endosome, therefore, chloroquine can theoretically block the penetration of such a broad spectrum of viruses, inactivating essential for viral penetration enzymes. However, at the molecular level the mechanism of antiviral activity of all these substances is not installed. In addition, understanding this process is complicated by their impact on the immune system during viral infection, especially when complications like acute respiratory distress syndrome (when required ventilator), plays a key role. Why could work? Chloroquine \u2014 simple and cheap substance that can be taken in tablet form (as opposed, for example, receiver). It is not without side effects, but is generally considered quite safe. Chloroquine blocks a good entry into the cell viruses SARS-CoV-1, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, i.e. in cell cultures. Previously, such results were shown for Chikugunya virus and Dengue. Why wouldn\u2019t it work? Antiviral effect requires a fairly high concentration of the substance. In addition, in vivo experiments on model animals, and randomized clinical trials Chikugunya and Dengue have not yielded any positive effect. In the experiments with SARS-CoV in special lines of mice that suffer from analogue middle East respiratory syndrome MERS, the use of chloroquine showed small positive results, but the concentration of virus in the blood is not decreased. In human studies, which are now being discussed, the situation was the opposite: the concentration of the virus fell, while significant clinical differences between the groups for a short time research has been found. What else is important to know? After the speeches, trump about the use of antimalarial drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 among specialists turned heated discussion about how justified the statements now about the effectiveness. According to the journal Science, the position of the American President primarily affect a small French study of a group of renowned virologist Didier Raul (he is known by the discovery of huge mimivirus and original anticarcinoma). In the work, preceded by several quite small for Chinese studies, the observation of 42 patients, half of whom were given hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin for six days was measured by the concentration of the virus in smears from the nose. The researchers conclude that the drug inhibits the replication of the virus and proved its effectiveness, but this study, many scientists have questions. First, they noticed that it is not a blind study in which doctors and patients knew what they are getting. Moreover, study participants chose to get them in the experimental group or control \u2014 and this decision, as you know, is affected by the severity of the condition. Second, the size of the control and experimental groups was very small. Third, the fence material with the help of a smear may not be quantitative and the concentration of the virus in it may be the result of random factors. Finally, the decrease in the concentration of the virus is not in itself a guarantee of healing; especially such diseases, the lethality associated with disruption of the immune system in acute respiratory syndrome. Read more about the claims this work can be read here, here, here and here. The arguments for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine who had dedicated ad hoc expert meeting, the results of which the document was created, where it is summarized the current status of research material. The solution, as mentioned above, it is customary for the inclusion of substances in the study of Solidarity. Short and clear: Proven efficacy against COVID-19 there is no need to wait for the results of large scale clinical trials. \u201cKaletra\u201d (lopinavir + ritonavir) with optional interferon What is it? Two protease inhibitor that used in antiretroviral therapy for HIV. Approved for this purpose in the United States in 2000. What is the mechanism of action? Lopinavir inhibits one protease (3CLpro), which is necessary for the virus to cut a large propeptide, which already produces other viral proteins, including those necessary for reproduction (replication) of the virus. Lopinavir itself is rapidly destroyed by proteases in human liver, so it is used in combination with another inhibitor with ritonavir. Why could work? Lopinavir inhibits replication of the SARS and MERS coronaviruses in vitro and in animal models. Lopinavir alone or in combination with interferon improved clinical outcomes in experiments involving monkeys and some patients with MERS. Why wouldn\u2019t it work? Lopinavir has already failed in a relatively large clinical study conducted in China. It was attended by 199 patients with COVID-19; members of the experimental group was given 400 mg of lopinavir and 100 mg ritonavir for two weeks, but no improvement in comparison with the control group was found. In addition, a significant number of people were recorded side effects. Short and clear: Proven efficacy against COVID-19 there is no need to wait for the results of large scale clinical trials. Receiver What is it? Analogue one of the \u201cletters\u201d of RNA, synthesized by chemists from the pharmaceutical company Gilead in 2012. What is the mechanism of action? Substance refers to the large class of nucleotide analogues, among which are often looking for specific antiviral agents. The substance can include the viral enzymes in the synthesis of new RNA, however, due to the fact that it is not \u201creal\u201d nucleotide after its incorporation into RNA is the open circuit \u2014 and the virus, thus, cannot reproduce. Why could work? Receiver works in vitro against many a very broad spectrum of RNA viruses, including the new coronavirus and Ebola virus. Group Ralph Baric, one of the most famous experts on coronaviruses in the world, have demonstrated the effectiveness of receiver in animal models of MERS even before the current pandemic. Why wouldn\u2019t it work? Receiver is a patented drug of Gilead, and its use outside the US is difficult \u2014 especially now, when the matter came high demand, and the company is under pressure from the public. Gilead has had to abandon its monopoly on the production of receiver. The second difficulty with receivera is that it is given in injection form and can not be preformed. This creates difficulties for preventive use, although the most effective receiver in the early stages of the disease. There are other problems: coronaviruses, in contrast to the influenza virus and many other viruses are RNA polymerases that can correct their mistakes. In such circumstances, the use of only one nucleotide analogues, without additional suppression of this ability can lead to quick formation of resistance. Short and clear: Proven efficacy against COVID-19 there is no need to wait for the results of large scale clinical trials. Alternative therapies At the end of March in the international database ClinicalTrials.gov it was 260 clinical studies of drugs or other therapy against COVID-19. Approximately the number of studies was in China, on the relevant national website. Among all these experimental interventions have and cell therapy, and the well-known poison colchicine and popular in Russia, Arbidol, and the transfusion of the serum had been ill, and, of course, all of the above antiviral drugs included in the who study. To give an adequate description of each of these potential drugs is impossible. As reported ForumDaily: A new virus was discovered in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. In 2020 it covers all continents except Antarctica. On 11 March, the President of the United States Donald trump has imposed a ban on entry into the United States from the EU. The ban came into force on Friday, March 13, and will last at least 30 days. In particular, it will affect people visiting the Schengen area for the last 14 days. On 13 March, the tramp of coronavirus introduced in the U.S. nationwide state of emergency. March 11, the who declared the situation with coronavirus pandemic, covering more than 110 countries.

Health COVID-19 lockdown should stay till end of winter: expert by David Mills and AAP 14th Apr 2020 2:27 PM premium_icon Subscriber only 0 One of Australia's leading infectious disease experts believes coronavirus travel and social restrictions should remain in place throughout winter to prevent a fresh outbreak. And other measures may need to continue for up to two years. Peter Collignon from the Australian National University said the timing of the global pandemic meant the country had dodged the worst of COVID-19. \"If you look at any respiratory virus, they transmit much more readily in winter,\" he told AAP today. Professor Collignon expects an uptick in coronavirus cases as more people retreat inside and the weather cools. \"All the factors aren't clear but what's beyond doubt is viral infections, respiratory infections are more common in winter and early spring.\" He believes rules rolled out since March had helped flatten the curve of coronavirus infections. Australia has shut down its borders, returned visitors have been quarantined, hospitality businesses have been closed and social gatherings dramatically curtailed. \"All those things that are pretty drastic and put a million people out of work, we're going to have to continue mostly till the end of winter,\" Professor Collignon said. He pointed to America and Europe, where winter saw many coronavirus cases go unrecognised initially. Australia's testing regime - one of the best in the world - has also helped keep the virus under control. But Australians could have to continue vigorous hygiene practices and avoid large crowds for up to two years. \"Unless something magically changes, we're going to have to do more than we've done before if we want to keep the numbers of this virus down,\" Professor Collignon said. \u00a0 CORONAVIRUS AND CLIMATE: IS THERE A LINK? Scientists around the world are investigating the impact of weather - including UV light - is having on potentially slowing the spread of coronavirus. An apparent link between a country's exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and its rate of COVID-19 transmission is prompting debate about what role sunlight plays in limiting outbreaks. Hong Kong University pathology professor John Nicholls said laboratory experiments had shown that the virus was sensitive to both heat and sunlight. The Adelaide University-trained professor told News Corp that \"at 4 degrees the virus shows very little activation, at 25 degrees celsius it can survive for about five days, and once you get to 35 degrees it's only one to two days\". \"This virus is quite heat sensitive. We've shown that in the laboratory. How much that can be extrapolated to the environment is a matter of conjecture,\" he said. \u00a0 \u00a0 Other lab experiments using simulated sunlight showed it also decreased the activity of the virus but Prof Nicholls said the effect may not be large. Using his research, US researchers found that Iceland - which has one of the lowest rates of UV exposure in the world - has one of the highest rates of COVID-19 infection, while Australia has comparatively low rates of infection. The researchers from weather website AccuWeather also looked at Chicago, which has a similar average daily temperature to Iceland, but its UV exposure is much higher, and its coronavirus caseload is ten times lower. The report acknowledged other variables were not factored in, and it should be noted that Iceland has tested a much bigger proportion of its population (5 per cent) compared to the US (0.2 per cent). \u00a0 The Kirkjufell mountain in Iceland. The remote Scandinavian island nation has one of the lowest UV indexes of any nation. \u00a0 The World Health Organisation stresses that \"exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25 degrees does not prevent coronavirus,\" but research into a possible link has ignited interest - and hope - as the northern hemisphere tracks towards summer. The 2003 SARS epidemic was largely extinguished as outbreak hot spots started to experience summary conditions. But some in the scientific community warn this may not happen with coronavirus. In a research paper that has not yet been peer reviewed, Professor Peter Byass from the University of Umea in Sweden looked at the climatic conditions that prevailed in China while it battled the initial outbreak of COVID-19, and he concluded that a \"clear cause and effect relationship\" between the weather and the virus had not been proven. \"The incidence of infections in China was markedly lower at very low temperatures, which might be related to characteristics of the virus, but equally may reflect reduced social interactions when it is very cold outside,\" Prof Byass wrote. \"Conversely brighter, drier weather may stimulate levels of social interaction, and thereby possibly counteract direct effects of heat and light on viruses.\" While Prof Byass found \"appreciable associations\" between rates of COVID-19 and the weather in China, he said this did not \"justify any generalisations to the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic will simply go away given some nice summer weather.\" \u00a0 Australia\u2019s average solar ultraviolet (UV) Index. \u00a0 But if Professor Nicholls is proved correct, and coronavirus \"does a SARS\", what of Australia and other southern hemisphere nations, heading towards winter? The Bureau of Meteorology's climate outlook for Australia, released on Thursday, forecasted wetter than average conditions for most of Australia, except southern Tasmania, for April, May and June. It also predicted warmer than average days across northern and eastern Australia, but cooler across much of the southern mainland. With regard to our exposure to UV radiation, information from the Bureau states that our lowest UV index days are likely to occur in June and July, when values can drop to less than 2 over Tasmania, and to 8 or 9 in far Northern Australia (which still puts it in the 'very high' range). \u00a0 Professor Peter Collignon, from the Australian National University Medical School in Canberra. \u00a0 Professor Peter Collignon from ANU's Medical School told News Corp that measures to stop the spread of the virus in Australia \"would need to be more stringent in winter\". \"Look at other viruses we've got. Influenza, common cold virus, other coronaviruses \u2026 [winter is] the peak spread of all respiratory viruses. Why that is, it's still not clear. \"It's probably because when you're cold everyone is indoors more and huddled together. It may also be something to do with the humidity in the air, because if you've got dry air you've got less mucous in your nose and maybe the virus has got an easier way of getting in there and causing infections, compared to if it's more humid and warmer,\" he said. \u00a0 COVID-19 and UV index by country graph. \u00a0 \"What's beyond doubt is that winter, everywhere in the world, you have ten or 20 times more transmission of respiratory viruses than you have in summer.\" Professor Nigel McMillan from the Menzies Health Institute at Griffith University said the impact of the weather on coronavirus was unclear at this stage. He concurred that there was a seasonable variation to virus infections, but pointed out that \"the flu season has smoothed out a lot over the last few years with so much travel between the hemispheres\". A fact sheet from the World Health Organisation states: \"You can catch COVID-19, no matter how hot or sunny the weather is. Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Originally published as COVID-19 lockdown should stay till end of winter: expert Professor John Nicholls from the University of Hong Kong More Stories premium_icon Revealed: When restrictions could ease Six most pressing coronavirus questions Facebook post leads to $1652 fines More Stories premium_icon Revealed: When restrictions could ease Six most pressing coronavirus questions Facebook post leads to $1652 fines 0 australia Read More Login to follow coronavirus Read More Login to follow expert Read More Login to follow lockdown Read More Login to follow winter Read More Login to follow australia coronavirus expert lockdown winter Top Stories premium_icon Tweed district police reveal fines for Easter long weekend News POLICE have given the region a big thumbs up after just ten repeat offenders were fined for disobeying coronavirus protection measures. 14th Apr 2020 2:30 PM premium_icon Why you should stop doing Facebook quizzes News COMPANIES promoting these quizzes are not doing it out of the kindness of their hearts to entertain us during home isolation. premium_icon What to expect when you are expecting in a pandemic News Bringing a life into the world comes with new rules as Tweed mothers-to-be face give birth during a pandemic. premium_icon Are you eating or drinking too much during isolation?

That\u2019s not something the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s commissioner Stephen Hahn would recommend. He made that clear Thursday after an eyebrow-raising moment at the daily White House coronavirus task force briefing. President Donald Trump suggested scientists should explore using UV light and disinfectant to treat the virus in humans. \u201cSo supposing we hit the body with a tremendous, whether it\u2019s ultraviolet or just very powerful light. And I think you said that hasn\u2019t been checked but you\u2019re going to test it. Then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you could do, either through the skin or some other way and I think you said you were going to test that, too. Sounds interesting,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThen I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute. Is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside, or almost a cleaning because you see it gets on the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it will be interesting to check that. That you\u2019re going to have to use medical doctors. But it sounds interesting to me,\u201d he added. Doctors warn high-intensity UV lamps and sun exposure will not protect you from the coronavirus. They also note that kind of exposure comes with other dangers.

President Donald Trump points to the sun as he arrives to view a solar eclipse, August 21, 2017, at the White House in Washington. Andrew Harnik/AP Direct sunlight could kill the coronavirus in minutes, the Department of Homeland Security suggested on Thursday. President Trump surmised that sunlight could be used on the human body \u2014 a claim that one epidemiologist called \"exceedingly dangerous.\" Experts say that sunlight won't protect you from COVID-19, and exposing yourself to UV light can be dangerous. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. Direct sunlight could rapidly kill the coronavirus on surfaces like stainless steel or in droplets that hang in the air. But it probably won't protect your body. Research at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) found that direct sunlight can cut the amount of live virus on a nonporous surface in half in just two minutes, according to William Bryan, who leads science and technology at the department. \"Our most striking observation to date is the powerful effect that solar light appears to have on killing the virus, both surfaces and in the air,\" Bryan said in Thursday's White House coronavirus task force briefing. Following those comments, President Donald Trump speculated about using sunlight on the human body as a protective measure against COVID-19.\u00a0 \"So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous, whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light, and I think you said, that hasn't been checked but you're gonna test it,\" he said, turning to Bryan. \"And then I said, supposing it brought the light inside the body, which you can either do either through the skin or some other way, and I think you said you're gonna test that too, sounds interesting.\" But experts say people shouldn't rely on sunlight as a disinfectant, and definitely not as a treatment or preventive measure for your body. \"His comments are exceedingly dangerous and not supported by medicine or science, and have troubling ramifications,\" Dr. Saskia Popescu, an infection-prevention epidemiologist who runs SvPrevention consulting, told Business Insider in an email. Hospitals use artificial UV light to disinfect objcts, but it's dangerous to humans A worker in protective suit shows a UVC sterilizer unit for medical staff, during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, at a factory in Samutprakarn, Thailand, April 15, 2020. Soe Zeya Tun/Reuters Sunlight emits two types of UV radiation: UVA and UVB. A third type, called UVC, doesn't make it through Earth's atmosphere. Hospitals, however, use UVC light to disinfect some surfaces, since it's powerful radiation that can kill microorganisms that might survive chemical treatment. \"In healthcare, UV disinfection is not a substitute for cleaning and disinfection, but rather a supplement to help cover more areas,\" Popescu said. Exposing yourself to that artificial disinfecting light can be extremely dangerous, however. \"UVC is really nasty stuff \u2013 you shouldn't be exposed to it,\" Dan Arnold, who works in sales at the company UV Light Technology, told the BBC. \"It can take hours to get sunburn from UVB, but with UVC it takes seconds. If your eyes are exposed \u2026 you know that gritty feeling you get if you look at the sun? It's like that times 10, just after a few seconds.\" Sunlight won't protect your body from COVID-19 People enjoy warm and spring-like weather during the coronavirus outbreak in Stockholm, Sweden, on April 22, 2020. ANDERS WIKLUND/TT NEWS AGENCY/AFP via Getty Images The sunlight you get outside, though less powerful than UVC light, can create an inhospitable environment for some viruses on certain surfaces. However, Popescu said, \"even if two people are out in the sun in close contact, if you cough on the other person or on their hands and they touch their face, the sun doesn't play a part in that.\" Other experts say there is no evidence that UV rays, either from the sun or from an artificial source, can prevent coronavirus infection. \"Going out in the sun or exposing yourself to these high-intensity UV lamps is not going to protect you from COVID-19,\" Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician at Rhode Island Hospital and an associate professor at Brown University, told CNN. \"I don't want people to think that this is another miracle cure.\" The sun sets behind a makeshift memorial for grocer Steve Shulman, who died from COVID-19, at Leschi Market in Seattle, Washington, March 19, 2020. Brian Snyder/Reuters The World Health Organization has also warned against it. \"Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease,\" the WHO's myth busters webpage reads. The page also cautions that \"UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.\" Sunlight is also not helpful if you're already infected, and it's unclear what Trump meant by getting it \"inside the body.\" \"UV irradiation and high heat are known to kill virus particles on surfaces,\" Dr. Penny Ward, a professor of pharmaceutical medicine at Kings College London, told the BBC. \"Neither sitting in the sun, nor heating, will kill a virus replicating in an individual patient's internal organs.\" 'I wouldn't rely on it' A worker disinfects playground equipment inside a kindergarten in Ganzhou, Jiangxi, in China. China Daily via Reuters Sunny outdoor areas are not necessarily virus-free. \"Take a playground equipment, for example,\" Bryan said at Thursday's briefing. \"The UV rays hitting a piece of playground equipment will kill the virus when it hits on the playground equipment, but underneath where the sun does not hit yet, if someone touched that on their hands, it could still be there. It has to be in direct light of the UV rays.\" But sunlight is also unlikely to be helpful for killing the virus in everyday life. \"I wouldn't rely on it. The surfaces we worry about are those high-touch ones, like doorknobs, counters, etc. \u2014 those are indoors,\" Popescu said. Loading Something is loading.

This is a continuation of last week\u2019s column where we looked at the basics of UV illumination covering both wavelength and fluorescence, and now we will report on what new research is being carried out to help stem the pandemic we are suddenly in. Since short wave UV light has the highest energy per photon in the UV spectrum, it has the greatest power to kill germs that reside on surfaces. This was first announced back in January 1878 when Arthur Downes and Thomas Blunt published a paper \u201cOn the Influence of Light upon Protoplasm\u201d in the Royal Society of London reports, where they described the sterilization of bacteria when exposed to light of various colors by using simple boxes equipped with light filters. More experimentation followed and a few years later the 1903 Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded to Niels Finsen, a Danish scientist, for his use of UV against lupus vulgaris, the bacteria that causes tuberculosis of the skin. Because UV light with wavelengths between 200 nm and 300 nm are strongly absorbed by nucleic acids, the absorbed energy can change the composition of bacteria cells including those with pyrimidine dimers. These modified dimers prevent replication of the cell and can prevent the expression of necessary proteins, resulting in the death or inactivation of the living organism. Using UV light to disinfect drinking water is an old process, dating back to 1910 when a prototype water treatment plant was constructed in Marseille, France. Six years later, the first US application of UV water disinfection was used in Henderson, Kentucky in a plant supplying water from the Ohio River. The equipment there used three mercury vapor arc lamps, all driven by a 220-volt direct current generator, where the water to be sterilized was run past the lamps housed within a large pipe. Running for many years, this location could clean 3 million gallons of water a day. UV lamps first became commercially available in 1930 and following the end of the Second World War in 1945, germicidal UV lamps became more and more commonly used to disinfect air. They were commonly found in public restrooms and as a kid I remember seeing the peculiar purple UV bulb through the air fins inside of a hand dryer at our local E.J. Korvettes store. What kind of bulbs can emit shortwave UV light? The most common is the low pressure mercury bulb. Invented by Peter Cooper Hewitt, American electrical engineer and inventor, in 1901, the lamp found widespread industrial use whenever UV illumination was needed. A high pressure variation of this bulb can still be found in streetlights or floodlights today. They are the ones that have a distinctive violet color, as opposed to the yellow sodium types. Tiny UV bulbs like the one in the hand dryer mentioned above are really low pressure mercury bulbs and have a thin quartz envelope outside in order to allow the transmission of short wavelength light. As mentioned last week, ordinary window glass will absorb the generated UV light. You can easily tell when that type of bulb is operating because the short wave UV radiation converts tiny amounts of the oxygen present in the air to ozone, O3, which has a pungent odor and which also has a deleterious effect on any microbes present. But because ozone is a highly reactive and unstable gas capable of damaging living cells, such as lung cells, its production, even from common hand dryers, has been regulated in many states. Besides mercury bulbs, ultraviolet light can also be generated by an LED (Light Emitting Diode). Some new solid state devices available on the market today include ones that can make wavelengths between 255 and 280 nanometers which do not have enough energy to produce ozone but can destroy bacteria. In time, however, you will see LEDs based on diamond structures that will emit even shorter rays. Some systems, such as the Skytron UV cleaning robot, are being used now to quickly disinfect jails, planes, buses, busy factories and operating rooms. They look like R2-D2 carrying a bank of UV lamps. Some versions come equipped with pulsed-xenon tubes that also emit short wave UV and are the cousins of the electronic flash that older cameras used to have where you would have to wait for the energy storage capacitor to charge up before you could take a photo. But can short wave UV light work on the new pandemic we are seeing? COVID-19 is a new breed, and as such there is a dearth of studies on its sensitivity to UV illumination. To be scientific, we can look to previous coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, for insight. Studies on these show that UV light does inactivate those viruses, so it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect that it will have a similar effect on COVID-19. For the past 4 years, a group at Columbia University Medical Center led by physicist David Brenner has tested various wavelengths of UV light and has found a certain band that eliminated bacteria and viruses on surfaces but did not harm lab mice. They are now shifting emphasis to COVID-19 and will have data soon according to their website. In China, whole buses are being lit up by rows of purple UV lights each night, back at the yard, where large short wave UV emitters \u201cscrub\u201d the internal surfaces clean.

Experts have advised against using concentrated UV light to prevent or treat the coronavirus and do not recommend going in the sunlight to kill the virus. The claim: Sunlight kills the new coronavirus An article on a holistic health blog that has been circulating Facebook tells people to go outside\u00a0to prevent catching the new coronavirus because sunlight kills it. \u201cIn my opinion, keeping the beaches closed and having people quarantined inside their homes is a bad decision. Getting more sunshine is a proactive step we can all take at protecting ourselves from the current coronavirus outbreak,\u201d wrote David Friedman, the author of the blog post. \u201cInstead of staying quarantined inside your house, go outside on your back deck and soak up some virus destroying sunshine!\" The claim has been shared elsewhere. Similar posts of graphics offering tips have spread throughout social media. Rep. Greg Murphy, a Republican who represents North Carolina\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, referenced the claim in a March video posted on his Twitter account.\u00a0 Murphy, a physician who worked in urology and renal transplantation, in the video stands in scrubs in front of a large white board and shares tips to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. One of the items on the list is \u201cSunlight (UV light) can kill the virus.\u201d USA TODAY reached out to Friedman and Murphy with requests for comment but did not receive a response from either. The claim also appeared in the Thai newspaper Komchadluek in March. The article listed UV light as one of seven \u201cthings that COVID-19 is afraid of.\u201d AFP Fact Check reported the article was shared in a Thai-language health group on Facebook with more than 6,000 followers and posted on social media multiple times, eventually translated into English and Spanish. \u00a0 What experts say: The sun\u2019s UV light cannot kill the coronavirus and concentrated UV light should not be used to kill the virus. The claim has been shared widely on the internet, but it holds little truth. Experts have advised against using concentrated UV light to prevent or treat the coronavirus and do not recommend going in the sunlight to kill the virus. Only levels of concentration of UV light much higher than what is found in sunlight can kill viruses, the experts note, and the levels that are able to kill viruses can cause irritation to human skin and should be avoided. Pokrath Hansasuta, assistant professor of virology at Chulalongkorn University,\u00a0explained what happens\u00a0to AFP Fact Check. \u201cUltraviolet is able to kill COVID-19 if it is exposed to the concentrated UV ray in a certain amount of time and distance,\u201d she said to AFP Fact Check. \u201cHowever, that level of UV exposure is harmful to human\u2019s skin. Most likely, it will be in the light bulb or lamp as the natural UV from the sun is not strong enough to kill it. The World Health Organization agrees. The agency created a graphic as part of a series of myth-busters about the coronavirus that tells the public not to use UV light to kill the virus.\u00a0 \u201cUV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation,\u201d\u00a0the graphic reads. Neither sunlight or UV light is listed as a preventative measure on the websites of the WHO or the\u00a0U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There is some evidence to suggest the spread of the virus may slow down as the weather gets warmer. That may be leading some to incorrectly suggest sunlight as a tip to stay healthy.\u00a0 TIME Magazine reported on new research\u00a0that has not yet been peer-reviewed. That research suggested the possibility of a connection between heat and the rate of the spread of the coronavirus, but experts have concluded that the\u00a0research is still early and not definitive. Nancy Messionnier, director of the CDC's Center for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases,\u00a0said\u00a0in a February NPR interview\u00a0it remains unclear\u00a0how the coronavirus will react to heat or sunlight. \"I think it's premature to assume that,\" Messionnier told NPR. \"We haven't been through even a single year with this pathogen.\" Our ruling: False Friedman referred to sunlight as \u201cvirus destroying sunlight.\u201d This is FALSE. There is no evidence proving sunlight kills the coronavirus. Only highly concentrated UV rays are reported to kill viruses and the World Health Organization advises against using UV rays\u00a0because it can cause damage to skin.

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin A bus is being disinfected by ultraviolet light on March 4, 2020 in Shanghai, China. According to ... [+] the latest guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of the novel coronavirus released by China's National Health Commission, the virus is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat, so ultraviolet radiation can effectively eliminate the virus. Visual China Group via Getty Images As the world turns to opening their economies after the great coronavirus shutdown, several strategies are being explored to prevent a \u2018second wave\u2019 outbreak, beyond contact-tracking apps. The first focus is high-risk, high-touch areas for disinfection, such as hospitals, delivery vans, grocery stores, mass transit systems, elevators, door handles, even cash. In high concentration cities, light railway, mass transit systems and public buses are a particularly challenging area.\u00a0Millions rely on such public infrastructure each day, and expensive, chemical based cleaning products may not be an efficient or a non-toxic way to clean public transport. Ultra-Violet light Today In: Manufacturing In Coronavirus Fight, Robots Report For Disinfection Duty Lloyd\u2019s Register And SAP Partner To Help Safeguard Our Essential Workers Ten Areas Where COVID-19 Responses Have Increased Environmental Risks Two UV-light-wielding virus fighting robots made by Xenex named WALL-E and Rosie deployed in ... [+] Massachusetts' Milford Regional Medical Center. Boston Globe via Getty Images In a well cited Scientific Reports article from 2018, far-UV light has been shown to kill over 95% of a virus like the current coronavirus. Normal UV is dangerous to humans and can result in cancer or cataracts in the eyes if there is over exposure.\u00a0Hence, extreme precaution needs to be taken using ultraviolet solutions. However, a type of ultraviolet light called far-UV is less dangerous to human cells, and can be used for several minutes in controlled environments without humans to disable the virus.\u00a0Far-UV light does not penetrate the outer cell layers of the skin or eye of humans, but can do so for the thinner fat layer in viruses, preventing them from multiplying. This works because the virus has a thin outer membrane, that can be more easily broken apart by UV rays. Installation in trains and buses A bus is being disinfected by ultraviolet light on March 4, 2020 in Shanghai, China. Visual China Group via Getty Images Such UV light is easily available as tubes that can either be slotted into existing transit system light sockets or attached to a fleet of moving robots. Autonomous UV-robot systems (which have more flexibility than fixed installations) are now being trailed in hospitals around the world, having seen measures adopted in China and South Korea as they prepared to re-open their economies. With light railways and low floor buses, fleets of such robots can roll in, switch on, and spend several minutes decontaminating each carriage.\u00a0This could be particularly useful at the end of the line for each train or bus, cutting cleaning times from 40 minutes to less than 5. UV trolleys deployed within buses in Shanghai can disinfect the bus within 5 minutes compared with ... [+] the usual 40 minutes of cleaning. Visual China Group via Getty Images It is challenging to clean a train mid-journey, so those exposed during the journey could still be at risk.\u00a0However, this would be orders of magnitude lower risk than allowing trains to travel up and down the line several times a day with a contaminated surface. In several high profile videos, buses in Shanghai went through decontamination tunnels each time they returned to their depot. A role for design thinking A staff member operates a robot to spray disinfectant on a street in Wuhan, central China's Hubei ... [+] Province, April 12, 2020. Xinhua News Agency/Getty Images Should Europe and the United States be preparing such autonomous UV systems to help decontaminate mass public transit in cities?\u00a0The world saw the scramble for ventilators and PPE during February and March as the virus spready around the world. Here is an opportunity to get ahead of the next wave of decisions. Other solutions being discussed to help safely re-open the economy include applying special anti-viral paint to high touch areas.\u00a0 This picture taken on April 16, 2020 shows an Indonesian technician examining robots during a ...

Many similarly innovative COVID-busting products have now emerged. Unleashing the creative energy of designers, innovators and entrepreneurs could identify many more solutions to safely and rapidly open the economy, whilst cities are still under \u2018stay at home\u2019 measures, rather than take the approach of \u2018Government knows best.\u2019 Taking such an approach could be what sets apart the innovative Government leaders from the rest, as the world moves to the next phase of managing this crisis.

As the coronavirus outbreak continues to impact daily life across the nation, several states have seen a spike in alcohol sales. While some experts have speculated that this may be due to people trying to stock up before stay-at-home orders are issued, it still appears that many are handling social distancing with a drink in their hand. Of course, this begs the question, if everyone is staying home to stay healthy amid a viral outbreak, is drinking hindering that effort? Dr. Shannon Sovndal, an ER doctor and author of \"Fragile,\" spoke with Fox News and explained the effect alcohol has on the body. \"People drink because it mellows them,\" he said. \"Well, alcohol has a similar effect on the immune system, making it slow and lethargic.\" He also explained how light drinking (having one drink a day) will likely only have a minimal effect, but heavier drinking can \"dampen\" all of your body's systems, including the immune system. MORE NEWS:\u00a022% of Floridians working from home are drinking alcohol during their shifts, survey says Fox News previously reported on a study that detailed the immediate impact getting drunk can have on the immune system. Based on the results, the immune system may see a brief boost about 20 minutes after \u201cpeak intoxication.\u201d Advertisement About 2 to 5 hours after getting drunk, however, that boost fades and the immune system significantly slows down. Researchers noticed a reduction in the white blood cells important to immunity, along with an increase in proteins that reduce the immune system\u2019s effectiveness. The Mayo Clinic's findings also indicate that drinking too much alcohol can have a negative impact on the body\u2019s immune system, specifically, that excessive drinking makes it harder for the body to resist disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) describes several different types of situations as \u201cexcessive drinking.\u201d This can include \u201cheavy drinking,\u201d which is defined as eight or more drinks per week for women, or 15 drinks or more per week for men. This can also include binge drinking, which is defined as five drinks or more, consumed within a 2\u20133-hour period for men, or four drinks during the same time period for women. MORE NEWS:\u00a0How to ensure you get your IRS coronavirus stimulus check The Mayo Clinic also says that excessive drinking increases the risk of developing pneumonia, which is a common illness developed among people who suffer from severe symptoms due to COVID-19, and can complicate recovery.

Myth/Fact from WHO release: \u2013 Myth: Consuming alcohol destroys the virus that causes COVID-19. + Fact: Consuming alcohol will not destroy the virus.* \u2013 Myth: Drinking strong alcohol kills the virus in the inhaled air. + Fact: Consumption of alcohol will not kill the virus in the inhaled air; it will not disinfect your mouth and throat; and it will not give you any kind of protection against COVID-19. \u2013 Myth: Alcohol (beer, wine, distilled spirits or herbal alcohol) stimulates immunity and resistance to the virus. + Fact: Alcohol has a deleterious effect on your immune system and will not stimulate immunity and virus resistance. *While alcohol of at least 60% by volume works as a disinfectant on your skin, it has \u201cno such effect within your system when ingested.\u201d \u201cDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, we should really ask ourselves what risks we are taking in leaving people under lockdown in their homes with a substance that is harmful both in terms of their health and the effects of their behaviour on others, including violence,\u201d said Carina Ferreira-Borges, Programme Manager, Alcohol and Illicit Drugs Programme, WHO/Europe. Per the most recent set of facts listed by WHO in their official \u201cAlcohol and COVID-19: what you need to know\u201d fact packet, alcohol not only does NOT fight COVID-19, it makes users more vulnerable to possible infection. Alcohol use, \u201cespecially heavy use,\u201d reduces the body\u2019s ability to cope with infectious diseases as it \u201cweakens the immune system.\u201d Further, heavy use of alcohol \u201cincreases the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),\u201d AKA one of the most severe complications of COVID-19.

In Iran, as reported in USA Today on March 10\u00a0\u2014 the day before the item surfaced on a Facebook post we found \u2014\u00a044 people died from bootleg alcohol they were drinking as a cure for COVID-19.

And it may even make you more susceptible. And there's more bad news about alcohol and viruses.

WHO said alcohol consumption was associated with a number of communicable and noncommunicable diseases that can make a person more vulnerable to catching the virus. \u201cAlcohol compromises the body\u2019s immune system and increases the risk of adverse health outcomes,\u201d the organisation said. \u201cTherefore, people should minimise their alcohol consumption at any time, and particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d In SA, co-operative governance minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma announced on Thursday that the ban on alcohol sales was still in place and would not be lifted during the lockdown. Dlamini-Zuma said the only alcohol allowed to be transported was that which is used for commercial purposes, such as for sanitisers. \u201cLiquor that you drink is not allowed to be exported or transported in the same way it is not allowed to be sold,\u201d she said. WHO noted that alcohol may put those with mental health struggles and a history of alcohol abuse at a greater risk because of increased self-isolation. The organisation said it may also raise the risk of domestic violence. \u201cDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, we should really ask ourselves what risks we are taking by leaving people under lockdown in their homes with a substance that is harmful both in terms of their health and the effects of their behaviour on others, including violence,\u201d said WHO's alcohol and illicit drugs programme manager, Carina Ferreira-Borges.

It won\u2019t kill the virus, either \u2014 the opposite is true. Excessive alcohol use can weaken the immune system, so in an attempt to curb drinking during the pandemic, WHO officials are urging governments around the world to enforce measures that limit alcohol consumption and crack down on coronavirus misinformation. \u201cAt times of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, alcohol consumption can exacerbate health vulnerability, risk-taking behaviours, mental health issues and violence,\u201d WHO/Europe said in a factsheet published on Tuesday. \u201cWHO/Europe reminds people that drinking alcohol does not protect them from COVID-19, and encourages governments to enforce measures which limit alcohol consumption,\u201d it said. The organization\u00a0published the statement\u00a0the same day President Donald Trump announced he\u2019d\u00a0cut WHO funding. And its first recommendation to combat the health risks of drinking? Well, not drinking at all. But many people could view that advice as extreme, since it comes at a time when much of the world is at home, Americans are\u00a0stockpiling alcohol\u00a0and\u00a0Zoom happy hours\u00a0have replaced bar get-togethers. All of those are reasons why, WHO says, now is a particularly bad time to drink in excess. Alcohol-related deaths number 3 million every year Excessive alcohol use\u00a0is already an issue, pandemic or not, said Carina Ferreira-Borges, programme manager for WHO\u2019s Europe Alcohol and Illicit Drugs Programme. Every year, there are at least 3 million alcohol-related deaths worldwide, according to WHO. During the pandemic, \u201cwe should really ask ourselves what risks we are taking in leaving people under lockdown in their homes with a substance that is harmful both in terms of their health and the effects of their behaviour on others, including violence,\u201d Ferreira-Borges said in WHO\u2019s statement on Tuesday. Existing rules to limit alcohol use should be \u201cupheld and even reinforced\u201d during the pandemic, WHO said, and relaxing regulations isn\u2019t a good idea, either. Alcohol won\u2019t kill coronavirus WHO went on to\u00a0disprove some conspiracies\u00a0about alcohol and Covid-19 \u2014 notably, that drinking it can kill the coronavirus or make people immune to it. Neither theory is true, WHO said: Heavy drinking can compromise the immune system and weaken its ability to defend against viruses, so if people do become infected with coronavirus, alcohol consumption may worsen the risk to their health. WHO said the theory that drinking high-strength ethyl alcohol or ethanol can kill the virus is false, too. While\u00a0products made with 60% or more alcohol\u00a0can effectively disinfect the skin, the same process won\u2019t work inside your body. So for our safety, WHO recommends that we abstain from alcohol. \u201cAvoid alcohol altogether so that you do not undermine your own immune system and health and do not risk the health of others,\u201d WHO\u00a0said in its fact sheet. \u201cIf you drink, keep your drinking to a minimum and avoid getting intoxicated.\u201d Liquor stores are essential businesses in most of the US In most states in the US, liquor stores and retailers that sell alcohol are\u00a0considered essential businesses. That designation has attracted some criticism, but certain health experts maintain that\u00a0keeping them open could prevent alcohol-dependent people\u00a0from experiencing withdrawal symptoms. There aren\u2019t published findings that show how the pandemic has impacted rates of alcohol consumption or alcohol use disorder across the population. But if sales data are any indication, people appear to be buying more alcohol \u2014\u00a0sales of alcoholic beverages shot up 55%\u00a0in the third week of March (the week before most states issued stay-at-home orders) compared to the same time last year, according to Nielsen.

Past studies have not found good evidence that the warmer temperatures and higher humidity of spring and summer will help tamp down the spread of the virus. But William Bryan of the Department of Homeland Security said at a White House briefing that there are \"emerging results\" from new research that suggest solar light has a powerful effect in killing the virus on surfaces and in the air. He said scientists have seen a similar effect from higher temperatures and humidity. A biocontainment lab in Maryland has been conducting testing on the virus since February, Bryan said. \"The virus is dying at a much more rapid pace just from exposure to higher temperatures and just from exposure to humidity,\" Bryan said. Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox Bryan said having more knowledge about this could help governors when making decisions about how and when to open their state economies. However, he stressed that the emerging results of the light and heat studies do not replace social distancing recommendations. Trump, who has consistently looked for hopeful news about containing the virus, was asked if it was dangerous to make people think they would be safe by going outside in the heat, considering that so many people have died in Florida. \"I hope people enjoy the sun. And if it has an impact, that's great,\" Trump replied, adding, \"It's just a suggestion from a brilliant lab by a very, very smart, perhaps brilliant man.\" \"I'm here to present ideas, because we want ideas to get rid of this thing. And if heat is good, and if sunlight is good, that's a great thing as far as I'm concerned,\" the president said. Trump noted that the researchers were also looking at the effects of disinfectants on the virus and wondered aloud if they could be injected into people, saying the virus \"does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it would be interesting to check that.\" Bryan said there was no consideration of that. The president has often talked up prospects for new therapies and offered rosy timelines for the development of a vaccine. Earlier in the month, scientific advisers told the White House there's no good evidence yet that the heat and humidity of summer will rein in the virus without continued public health measures. Researchers convened by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine analyzed studies done so far to test virus survival under different laboratory conditions as well as tracking where and how COVID-19 has spread so far. \"Given that countries currently in `summer' climates, such as Australia and Iran, are experiencing rapid virus spread, a decrease in cases with increases in humidity and temperature elsewhere should not be assumed,\" the researchers wrote earlier in April in response to questions from the White House Office of Science and Technology. In addition, the report cited the global lack of immunity to the new virus and concluded, \"if there is an effect of temperature and humidity on transmission, it may not be as apparent as with other respiratory viruses for which there is at least some preexisting partial immunity.\" They noted that during 10 previous flu pandemics, regardless of what season they started, all had a peak second wave about six months after the virus first emerged. In March, Dr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization's emergencies chief. said, \"We have to assume that the virus will continue to have the capacity to spread, and it's a false hope to say yes, it will just disappear in the summertime like influenza.\" RELATED IMAGES view larger image U.S. President Donald Trump speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House, Thursday, April 23, 2020, in Washington.

DHS S&T's re COVID-19 (April 13, 2020) results: Virus lives longer at low humidity and inactivates faster at higher humidity; virus lives longer at low temperatures and inactivates faster as temperature increases; Sunlight destroys the virus quickly. By Rico - 18 April 2020 86 Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp Linkedin ReddIt Email Print Good news for us, bad for the coronavirus. The national weather service, the Instituto Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional (IMN) is predicting a Sunday (tomorrow) of clear skies throughout the country, which will mean lots of sunshine, hot all over and muggy in many places. DHS S&T\u2019s re COVID-19 (April 13, 2020) results: Sunlight destroys the virus quickly. Download the DHS S&& briefing here or read it below. So, why is this good news for us and not so much for the virus? An article published Friday on Yahoo News tells us that preliminary results from government lab experiments in the U.S. show that the coronavirus does not survive long in high temperatures and high humidity, and is quickly destroyed by sunlight The latest weather forecast from the IMN here. The study found that, from controlled tests of what scientists believed \u2014 but had not yet proved \u2014 to be true, the risk of \u201ctransmission from surfaces outdoors is lower during daylight\u201d and under higher temperature and humidity conditions. \u201cSunlight destroys the virus quickly,\u201d reads the briefing marked for official use only and obtained by Yahoo News. Virus lives longer at low humidity and inactivates faster at higher humidity; virus lives longer at low temperatures and inactivates faster as temperature increases; Sunlight destroys the virus quickly. DHS S&T\u2019s re COVID-19 (April 13, 2020) results Qasim Bukhari, a computational scientist at MIT and a co-author of the analysis, told Yahoo News in an interview. \u201cNo, we are not saying it (that at higher temperatures, the virus will suddenly go away). We are just seeing that there is a temperature \u2013 and humidity-related dependency, but I think many people now have started to realize this.\u201d Arthur Anderson, former director of the Office of Human Use and Ethics at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Md, told Yahoo News, that \u201cwhile the new lab results are important, the science behind how sunlight kills the virus is fairly well established\u201d. \u201c[Ultraviolet] light breaks DNA into fragments. If the virus is floating around in the air and there\u2019s bright sunlight, the UV component in sunlight will break the DNA or the RNA into pieces,\u201d he told Yahoo News. DHSST by Sharon Weinberger on Scribd Hope is in the sun The preliminary results offer hope that sunny, hot and muggy conditions is less hospitable for the virus, though experts caution it will by no means eliminate, or even necessarily decrease, new cases of COVID-19. Clear skies over the entire country are expected on Sunday And guess what, in Costa Rica, we have a lot of sunny, hot days and muggy conditions. Even in the \u201crainy\u201d or \u201cwet\u201d (winter) season that the country is currently transitioning to. Hopefully, the sun will also transition us out of the \u201czero\u201d (or \u2018cero\u2019 in Spanish) season. ", "label": 0, "Q0": "Q0", "c_score": "0.3786288899999999"}

Despite a 34-day lockdown, we\u2019re still seeing positive cases emerge from different areas, bringing more and more containment zones under lock and key. This left many wondering about adequate safety measures which would enable movement and work, as the shuttered India has barely been able to earn during this time. Frequent disinfection and sanitisation are good ideas, but they need better companions to help beat the disease. AMFAH India \u2013 a Group Company of AMFAH GENERAL LLC Dubai, a producer of domestic/commercial De-humidifiers, Air Purifiers and Portable Air Conditioners, recently reported atmospheric findings for COVID-19 basis the research study conducted by them on three cities in India with the highest number of coronavirus positive cases. AMFAH\u2019s atmospheric findings for COVID-19 Having tabled IAQ solutions against COVID-19, AMFAH India, in a research paper, \u2018Temperature Control, Humidity and Lifestyle Changes to Curb Transmission of COVID-19\u2019, has highlighted the role that these three play in keeping us safe. \u201cAir quality, especially indoor air quality, governs our risk levels for the coronavirus. A poor air quality (lower than PM 2.5 level) would heighten existing difficulties, especially for COVID positive cases. Sanitised, ventilated spaces also add to safe living conditions for everyone, whether at homes or outside,\u201d AMFAH India team said, as it shared the AMFAH research report with the public. The report carries a similar caveat about temperature control. \u201cFor countries with tropical and hot weather like India, the temperature has to be regulated between 25 degree Celsius to 32 degree Celsius.\u201d The research exercise and findings For this research, the AMFAH team began to compile and analyse ambient air data for all COVID-19 affected countries on one end and the high-impact states in India on the other end. In both areas, they took data for three cities that had been hit worst by the outbreak. They observed three components \u2013 air quality, temperature and humidity. The report cited air quality as a critical factor in controlling the outbreak. \u201cGood air quality, ventilation and avoiding ACs could help break this cycle. The use of air conditions must be avoided completely or restricted to minimal. ACs above 27 degrees can lead to precipitation and increase relative humidity beyond safe limits\u201d, observed the report. \u201cHumidity is an essential factor which affects the spread of airborne and human-to-human transmission diseases. Our team began to track the spread of the coronavirus worldwide, alongside the humidity levels in these areas\u201d, the report read. \u201cWe saw that areas with low temperatures and high humidity (New York with average 6 degrees and high relative humidity of 82 per cent, Italy and Spain with 9-13 degrees and 80 per cent humidity) had the highest number of cases\u201d, it further read. Holding the opposite true would not be precisely correct either. The outbreak in Singapore broke myths that high temperature and high humidity would not invite Covid-19 cases. The report findings suggest that it is very sure that the prevention lies in controlling mechanically in indoor areas, moreover with the ongoing pandemic the team with few associates are on the job tracking the task very closely till normalcy returns. Behavioural and Lifestyle changes AMFAH team also talked about particular lifestyle and behaviour changes that were required. \u201cConsumption of cold beverages, using ice and cold water can impact respiratory organs, which makes people more vulnerable. Simple changes like drinking warm water and warm beverages are extremely helpful in boosting immunity too. Wearing masks and practising excellent respiratory hygiene like covering the face before coughing or sneezing can help curb the disease,\u201d the report suggested.

To fight these myths and lies, the WHO created a series of NEW YORK - The outbreak of a new coronavirus in late 2019 has sickened tens of thousands of people worldwide. The illness, called COVID-19, is a global pandemic. The World Health Organization has urged governments, businesses and individuals to take steps to deal with the spread of the virus. \"This is a new virus and a new situation. We're all learning, and we must all find new ways to prevent infections, save lives, and minimize impact,\" Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director-general, said on Friday. \"All countries have lessons to share.\" >>DEVELOPMENTS AND RESOURCES AT CORONAVIRUSNOW Misinformation about COVID-19 has spread far and fast online. To fight these myths and lies, the WHO created a series \"mythbusters\" based on the latest clinical and research information about the novel coronavirus. Here are those mythbusters, as compiled\u00a0by WHO: Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus? Advertisement Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?\u00a0 People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus. Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus? No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus? No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus? No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts. How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus? Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever because of infection with the new coronavirus. However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus? No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus? No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the new coronavirus. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer. Can the new coronavirus be transmitted through mosquito bites? To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus? UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. Can taking a hot bath prevent the new coronavirus disease? No, taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you. Can the COVID-19 virus be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates? From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19. Will cold weather and snow kill the new coronavirus? There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C, regardless of the external temperature or weather. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus? To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus. However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. >>DEVELOPMENTS AND RESOURCES AT CORONAVIRUSNOW Latest News Publix adjusting hours at all locations amid concerns over coronavirus What Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration means for the COVID-19 pandemic Philadelphia police corporal fatally shot serving warrant in Frankford; suspects in custody CDC\u2019s \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 graphic shows why social distancing amid coronavirus pandemic is necessary Retired Melbourne couple recreate canceled cruise in their living room \u00a0 Trending 'Edward Scissorhands' carved his way into hearts of Americans from a set in Lutz, 30 years ago What it's like to have COVID-19: Florida patient urges kindness as he recovers in isolation Busch Gardens, Adventure Island and SeaWorld closing to prevent spread of COVID-19 Number of novel coronavirus cases in Florida hits 46 Duke Energy will not disconnect service for nonpayment during coronavirus outbreak News Watch Live Local Consumer Health Coronavirus in Florida Politics FOX 13 Investigates Seen on TV Weather SkyTower Radar Views Live Radar Feed Interactive Radar Marine Weather Live Webcams Tropics MyFoxHurricane Good Day Traffic Charley's World Hometown Heroes Extraordinary Ordinaries Recipes First Birthdays Sports Buccaneers Rays Lightning High School Sports We Live Here What's Right One Tank Trips Theme Parks Bay Area Best Care Force About Us FOX 13 News Staff What's On FOX Contests WTVT History Jobs & Internships Closed Captioning Contact Us facebook twitter instagram email Updated Privacy Policy Terms of Service Do Not Sell my Personal Information FCC Public File EEO Public File About Us Jobs at FOX 13 Contact Us This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92020 FOX Television Stations", "label": 0, "Q0": "Q0", "c_score": "0.4186289980000001"}

By Natalie Rahhal Acting Us Health Editor Published: 16:06 EDT, 23 March 2020 | Updated: 17:04 EDT, 23 March 2020 e-mail 11 shares 19 View comments Rising temperatures and humidity levels will likely slow the spread of coronavirus around the globe, a new study suggests - but changing weather can't stop the disease alone.\u00a0 As the weather grew warmer and more humid in 100 Chinese cities researchers at Beihang University and Tsinghua University found that the transmission rate of COVID-19 fell.\u00a0 'High temperature and high relative humidity significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-1, the study authors wrote.\u00a0 President Donald Trump for weeks assured the American public that coronavirus, which has now infected more than 41,000 people in the US would likely fade by April because 'the heat generally speaking kills this kind of virus.'\u00a0 Although public health experts and the new study suggest that the virus doesn't thrive in warm temperatures, heat and humidity will only reduce the transmission rate - not stop it in its tracks.\u00a0 As temperatures rose in 100 Chinese cities, the average number of people who those infected with coronavirus passed it to fell from 2.5 to less than 1.5, Chinese researchers found\u00a0 A similar trend was seen with rising humidity, with transmission rates rarely exceeding three when humidity rose to 100% in the cities they assessed. Each blue dot signifies the average number of transmissions per infected person at a given humidity level, meaning that on days when humidity was 100%, the transmission rate hovered mostly below two per infected person Since COVID-19 emerged in China in December, the virus has spread like wildfire to more than 350,000 people worldwide amid cold weather.\u00a0 In China, the outbreak reached its peak in February with more than 15,000 cases diagnosed in a single day.\u00a0 But it's officially spring there now, and with the departure of winter has come a precipitous fall of cases in China.\u00a0 Last week, China reported no new cases of coronavirus from local transmission - an encouraging development, if one met by some skepticism.\u00a0 RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next US now has the THIRD most coronavirus infections in the... North Carolina company is making a coronavirus test that can... Share this article Share It came just before the first day of spring (which was Saturday, March 21), but also followed draconian measures that locked down tens of millions of people in Wuhan and other Chinese cities.\u00a0 Parsing out the role in weather in China's seemingly successful fight against COVID-19 from other factors is more difficult than simply looking at case numbers and temperatures.\u00a0 In an effort to do just that, the researchers at Beihang and Singhua universities assessed data on more than 100 cities in China where there were 40 or more cases of coronavirus between January 21 and January 23.\u00a0 They predict that transmission rates will fall to the rate of one person per every infected individual in areas where humidity and temperatures will rise in tandem during the spring and summer months, such as the Easter half and far West Coast of the US\u00a0 Nearly 42,000 Americans have been infected with coronavirus. President Trump has said optimistically that the heat might kill the virus, but it's not expected to remain active in the US through the summer despite warmer temperatures\u00a0\u00a0 They tracked the estimated number of transmissions, temperatures and humidities in those cities prior to January 24, when lockdowns went into place and Lunar New Year celebrations were cancelled.\u00a0 Using the R coefficient, a number that measures the average number of people each person with coronavirus infects, the team tracked transmission rates.\u00a0 They adjusted these numbers to account for factors that might otherwise influence the transmission rate, like how densely populated or wealthy each city was.\u00a0 After doing so, they estimated the average number of people that each person with the virus would pass it on to.\u00a0 Experts worldwide have tried to estimate the R0, or spread of the disease. It seems to hover between 2 and 2.5, meaning that every person infected gives coronavirus to between two and two-and-a-half people.\u00a0 But that value falls as temperatures and humidity rise, according to the authors of the Chinese study, published earlier this month.\u00a0 'One degree Celsius increase in temperature and one percent increase in relative humidity lower R by 0.0383 and 0.0224, respectively.'\u00a0 Warmer weather is unlikely to spare the US health care system from becoming overwhelmed. Pictured: A National Guard member in Florida strips off his PPE at a COVID-19 testing site The researchers not that new cases per day remained lowest in more tropical, warm environments like Thailand and Malaysia, while transmissions were high in drier Iran and Korea It's a small impact, but not one to be dismissed, according to the researchers.\u00a0 'In the early dates of the outbreaks, countries with relatively lower air temperature and lower humidity (e.g. Korea, Japan and Iran) saw severe outbreaks than warmer and more humid countries (e.g. Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand) do,' the study authors wrote.\u00a0\u00a0 Scientists aren't entirely sure why so many viruses - including the broader coronavirus family to which COVID-19 belongs - fare better in colder temperatures in the environment. But we do know that the human immune system is depressed during the winter. Colder, dryer air dries up the mucous in our noses that act as a first line of defense, and respiratory viruses typically enter through the nasal passageway.\u00a0 Certain immune cells, called phagocytes, also seem to be less active in the body at colder temperatures, meaning they're less likely to spot and kill viruses.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By the Chinese researchers' equation, if the temperature in the US increases by 15 degrees C, or 27 degrees F, an infected person would spread coronavirus to about 0.6 fewer people.\u00a0 Coupled with social distancing, this could go a long way to reduce the virus's spread, but it's not a full stop, as some studies citing that the virus can't survive at 86 degrees F might suggest.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Advertisement Share or comment on this article: High temperatures and humidity can 'significantly' slow the spread of coronavirus e-mail 11 shares Add comment Comments 19 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated \u00a0 View all The comments below have not been moderated. \u00a0 View all The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.

One potentially lethal example is that patients who take the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, particularly angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), maybe more susceptible to the virus. ARBs are prescribed for high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, kidney disease and other conditions. However, in an article published in the journal Hypertension, researchers warn there is little credible or consistent evidence to back up this concern. \u201cThe only thing we can conclude definitively, based on all the known data, is that there is no credible evidence whatsoever that ARBs enhance susceptibility to COVID,\u201d said study researcher Murray Epstein from the University of Miami in the US. In the study, the research team carefully reviewed the available data to determine whether ARBs pose any significant risk. They noted the concern originated from reports that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) protein receptor may enable viral entry into cells. Amplified by various media, this led some patients to discontinue their medications \u2013 either on their own or based on advice from a physician. However, the evidence that ARBs may increase COVID-19 risk is inconsistent, at best. Though some studies have shown ARBs increase ACE 2 activity in animal models, it must be emphasised that the results have been inconsistent, the researchers said. What investigators have found varies widely, depending on the organ studied, the experimental animal model and the ARB being used in the study. \u201cIn summary, there is a complete lack of consistency,\u201d Epstein said. While there is no credible evidence that ARBs increase COVID-19 risk, the researchers noted that there are clear dangers for patients who stop taking their medications. Widespread discontinuation of ARBs and ACE inhibitors could cause destabilisation of blood pressure control and decompensation of heart failure patients, leading to sharp increases in heart attacks and strokes and a worsening of kidney failure. \u201cThis would be a double tragedy because it would be happening precisely at a time when our hospital and ICU resources are stressed to the limit,\u201d said Epstein. \u2013IANS bu/na Tags: inaccurate media pills scientists social Comments: 0 Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

The findings of the study are published in the journal Hypertension. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, inaccurate medical information has flooded social media and other channels. A one potentially lethal example is that patients who take renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, particularly angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), maybe more susceptible to the virus. However, in an article published in the American Heart Association journal Hypertension, Murray Epstein, M.D., emeritus professor of medicine at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, and colleagues warn there is little credible or consistent evidence to back up this concern. Equally important, foregoing these important medications would dramatically increase health risks for hundreds of millions of patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. \u2018There is no evidence to support the notion that ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker administration facilitates coronavirus entry. Hence, Kidney and heart disease patients should keep taking their medicines. \u2019 \"The only thing we can conclude definitively, based on all the known data, is that there is no credible evidence whatsoever that ARBs enhance susceptibility to COVID,\" said Dr. Epstein, who edits the only medical textbook that focuses exclusively on ARBs. In the article \"Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers and the COVID-19 pandemic: at present there is no evidence to abandon RAS blockers,\" Dr. Epstein and coauthors Jan Danser, Ph.D., of Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, and Daniel Batlle, M.D., at Northwestern University, carefully reviewed the available data to determine whether ARBs pose any significant risk. They note the concern originated from reports that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) protein receptor may enable viral entry into cells. Amplified by various media, this led some patients to discontinue their medications - either on their own or based on advice from a physician. However, the evidence that ARBs may increase COVID-19 risk is inconsistent, at best. Though some studies have shown ARBs increase ACE 2 activity in animal models, it must be emphasized that the results have been inconsistent. \"People are making an unadvised leap,\" said Dr. Epstein. \"The logic goes that, if it enhances penetrability, it enhances susceptibility to the disease, but that's a dangerous conclusion. What investigators have found varies widely, depending on the organ studied, the experimental animal model, and the ARB being used in the study.

In fact, there seems to be a growing chorus of experts suggesting that these drugs may actually be of benefit in COVID-19. \"[T]he biological plausibility of salutary effects of ACEs/ARBs in those with COVID-19 is intriguing,\" write the authors of a viewpoint article, Chirag Bavishi, MD, MPH, Medical School of Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island; Thomas M Maddox, MD, MSc, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri; and Frank Messerli, MD, University of Bern, Switzerland. Several papers discussing this topic have been published in the last week, including the one by Bavishi et al\u00a0published online\u00a0April 3 in\u00a0JAMA Cardiology. Trials to test renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers in COVID-19 patients are underway. Currently in the planning stage are two randomized controlled trials to test the initiation of the ARB\u00a0losartan\u00a0in patients with COVID-19 in the outpatient setting (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier\u00a0NCT04311177) and in the in-patient setting (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier\u00a0NCT04312009). Still, both trials will be small and won't be completed before the spring of 2021. Other trials are also underway, but will take time. An\u00a0observational study\u00a0is beginning in Italy. \"Trials testing RAAS antagonists, including ones we are about to implement, in my opinion, form a strategic line of research toward secondary preventions, ie, halting disease progression in the early stages,\" said Majd AlGhatrif, MD, National Institute on Aging and Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, lead author of a second viewpoint article\u00a0published online\u00a0April 3 in\u00a0JAMA Cardiology. \"In this active phase of the pandemic, early results can allow implementing these preventive measures at a scale compatible with that of the pandemic given the abundance of these medications in the market. If non-early results are conclusive, these will still be valuable, as we are expecting an additional cycle or two of this infection. We would rather not have these flares, but we better be prepared should they happen,\" he added in comments to\u00a0theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology. Continued All major\u00a0cardiology professional societies, including the European Society of Cardiology, The American College of Cariology, American Heart Association,\u00a0Heart Failure\u00a0Society of America, British Cardiovascular Society, and Canadian Cardiovascular Society, have all published guidance suggesting that ACE inhibitors and ARBs should be continued in patients with COVID-19, unless there is a clear reason to stop them. Despite the consensus that there is no reason to discontinue ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients with COVID-19, most suggest that given the current lack of strong evidence of benefit for these agents, they should not be initiated in the absence of a clear clinical indication.The controversy, which is not much of a controversy anymore, revolves around the discovery that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors to enter cells. Reports, mainly from animal studies, that ACE inhibitors and ARBs may increase expression of ACE2 led to concerns that users of these drugs may have increased susceptibility or severity of COVID-19. Not only do experts in this field think this isn't the case, but rather they suspect just the opposite may be true: ACE inhibitors and ARBs may actually protect against lung injury in COVID-19. AlGhatrif and colleagues point out that, based on animal studies, ACE2 expression declines with age, which is consistent with profound proinflammatory, age-associated changes in the renin\u2013angiotensin system leading to higher angiotensin signaling. In fact, the upregulation of ACE2 in patients treated with ACE inhibitors and ARBs is, \"in a way, restorative of physiological function,\" they write. But this creates a paradox: if ACE2 is the gateway into the body for SARS-CoV-2, \"how can the reduction in ACE2 levels in older persons and those with CVD predispose for greater COVID-19 severity?\" AlGhatrif and colleagues ask. They resolve this paradox with the hypothesis that greater expression of ACE2 leads to higher predisposition to the disease. The higher rate of COVID-19 found in young people in South Korea, the only country testing large numbers of younger and asymptomatic individuals, supports this idea. However, when it comes to severity, reductions in ACE2 in older individuals with cardiovascular disease and its associated upregulation of the angiotensin 2 proinflammatory pathway seems to predispose these people to more severe disease. Continued This has been clearly seen in Italy, where the mean age of those who have died in\u00a0one case series\u00a0was 79.5 years. AlGhatrif said their hypothesis extends the discussion beyond just the potential role of RAAS intervention in COVID-19 to suggest that \"age-associated reduction in ACE2, counterintuitively, underpins the greater disease severity observed in the elderly.\" Other writers have focused more on the role of ACE2 rather than the role of its potential reduction with aging, or other conditions, as a potential predisposing factor for severe outcomes, he said. \"Hence, compared with younger individuals, older persons with CVD who already have reduced ACE2 levels will be expected to be more predisposed to exaggerated inflammation with further reduction in ACE2 expression in the context of COVID-19, manifesting in greater disease severity,\" write AlGhatrif and colleagues. \"First, one must recognize the scarcity of data on the topic, particularly in humans,\" AlGhatrif told\u00a0theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology.\u00a0\"Nonetheless, the urgency of the situation makes it imperative to use inductive reasoning to guide our next steps toward protecting our patients.\" Medscape Medical News Sources JAMA Cardiol.\u00a0Published online April 3, 2020.

Nearly half of Americans have high blood pressure, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). Based on current knowledge, seniors \"with coronary heart disease or high blood pressure may be more susceptible to the coronavirus and more likely to develop more severe symptoms. That means it's vital to follow guidance about keeping other conditions well-controlled and maintaining good health and hygiene,\" the AHA said in a news release. Data from Wuhan, China, show a 10.5% death rate among people with Covid-19 who also have heart disease, 7.3% among those with diabetes, 6.3% among those with respiratory disease and 6% for those with high blood pressure. Keep on taking your meds Some people wonder if blood pressure or heart medications could make people with Covid-19 sicker, so the AHA, Heart Failure Society of America and American College of Cardiology recently issued guidelines. Don't stop taking prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) medications for high blood pressure, heart failure or heart disease, the guidelines said. These medications don't increase the risk of contracting Covid-19 and are crucial in maintaining blood pressure levels to reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke and worsening heart disease. Heart disease patients with Covid-19 should be evaluated by their health care provider before stopping or adding medications, the guidelines added. Any changes to medication should be based on the latest scientific evidence and shared decision-making. Some over-the-counter (OTC) medicines and supplements can raise blood pressure, including common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) pain medicines, such as naproxen (Aleve) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and also decongestants. People with heart problems should avoid or limit use of these drugs, especially if their blood pressure is uncontrolled. OTC drugs such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) are less likely to increase blood pressure. Ask your doctor about OTC medicines. Home remedies might not be safe People taking prescription medications for mental health, corticosteroids, birth control pills, immunosuppressants and some cancer medications should monitor their blood pressure to make sure it's under control, the AHA advises. Too much alcohol and caffeine can boost blood pressure, and people with high blood pressure should avoid or limit their intake of both. Some so-called natural supplements and home remedies might not be safe. For example, liquorice herbal supplements can raise blood pressure, the group said. The AHA also recommends that people with high blood pressure and heart disease have enough prescription medications to last for a prolonged period, or see if they can get a larger supply than normal. Mail-order may be available for people who can't or don't want to leave home to get their medications. It's also important to keep follow-up medical appointments. Some doctors' offices offer virtual visits when feasible. READ | How does a severe coronavirus infection possibly injure the heart?

REUTERS/Benoit Tessier (reuters_tickers) By Deborah J. Nelson (Reuters) - Scientists are baffled by how the coronavirus attacks the body - killing many patients while barely affecting others. But some are tantalized by a clue: A disproportionate number of patients hospitalized by COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, have high blood pressure. Theories about why the condition makes them more vulnerable \u2013 and what patients should do about it \u2013 have sparked a fierce debate among scientists over the impact of widely prescribed blood-pressure drugs. Researchers agree that the life-saving drugs affect the same pathways that the novel coronavirus takes to enter the lungs and heart. They differ on whether those drugs open the door to the virus or protect against it. Resolving that question has taken on new urgency after an April 8 report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that 72% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients 65 or older had hypertension. The drugs are known as ACE inhibitors and ARBs, broad categories that include Vasotec, Valsartan, Irbesartan, as well as their generic versions. In a recent interview with a medical journal, Anthony Fauci - the U.S. government\u2019s top infectious disease expert - cited a report showing similarly high rates of hypertension among COVID-19 patients who died in Italy and suggested the medicines, rather than the underlying condition, may act as an accelerant for the virus. Efforts to understand how the virus uses the pathway to the heart and lungs, and the role of the medicines, are complicated by a lack of rigorous studies. \u201cThere are millions of Americans that take an ACE inhibitor or AR daily,\u201d said Dr Caleb Alexander, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness in Baltimore. \u201cThis is one of the most important clinical questions.\u201d An estimated 100 million U.S. residents suffer from high blood pressure, which increases the risk of heart disease, stroke and kidney failure. About four-fifths of them need to take prescription drugs to control it, according to the CDC. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are widely prescribed to patients with congestive heart failure, diabetes or kidney disease. The drugs account for billions of dollars in prescription sales worldwide. The absence of clear answers on how the drugs impact COVID-19 patients has sparked rampant speculation in correspondence and editorials posted on medical journal websites and those where scientists share unreviewed, pre-publication study drafts. Many patients are agonizing over whether their medicines will help or hurt them. Doris Kertzner, 88, of Redding, Conn., said she has carefully followed experts\u2019 guidelines for preventing infection and keeps her distance from others in her retirement community. Now she has a new worry: She takes losartan, an ARB, and can\u2019t decide whether to stop. Dropping the medicine \u201cpresents its own problems\u201d in dealing with her high blood pressure. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten very complicated,\u201d she said. Dr Carlos M. Ferrario - a researcher at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine and co-author of widely cited studies on ACE inhibitors - understands patients\u2019 plight. \u201cThere is a lot of paranoia and a lot of speculation with very little fundamental, convincing information,\u201d he said. The National Institutes of Health in the United States has put out a call seeking proposals for studies into the issue. An independent consortium of researchers has launched a global study to analyze health records for thousands of COVID-19 patients in the United States, Europe and Asia. That project is part of the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics program, an open-source research platform that enables large-scale studies. Dr Marc Suchard - a biostatistician at the University of California, Los Angeles who is leading the study - said that it aims to determine whether the medicines make infections more likely or more severe - or, by contrast, whether they help protect against the virus. Suchard said he expects a preliminary report within two weeks. MORE TARGETS FOR THE VIRUS There is evidence that the drugs may increase the presence of an enzyme - ACE2 - that produces hormones that lower blood pressure by widening blood vessels. That's normally a good thing. But the coronavirus also targets ACE2 and has developed spikes that can latch on to the enzyme and penetrate cells, researchers have found. So more enzymes provide more targets for the virus, potentially increasing the chance of infection or making it more severe. Other evidence, however, suggests the infection's interference with ACE2 may lead to higher levels of a hormone that causes inflammation, which can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome, a dangerous build-up of fluid in the lungs. In that case, ARBs may be beneficial because they block some of the hormone\u2019s damaging effects. Novartis International AG and Sanofi SA are among the major drugmakers selling ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Sanofi spokesman Nicolas Kressmann said that patients should consult their doctors on whether to continue taking the drugs but that the company has found insufficient evidence that they worsen COVID-19 through its own assessment of available scientific data. The company reviewed several recent studies from China that came to conflicting conclusions about whether COVID-19 patients with hypertension fare worse than other patients, he said. Novartis has not issued any guidance to clinicians or patients and defers to scientists studying the issue, said spokesman Eric Althoff. Researchers and doctors generally agree that people with severe hypertension or heart failure should keep taking the drugs because of the high risks of stopping. The debate centers on how to advise the many patients with milder conditions who take the drugs. Two camps have emerged - one calling for no action unless the drugs are proven dangerous, the other for some limits on their use until they are proven safe. The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at University of Oxford in England has recommended that clinicians consider withdrawing the medicines in patients with mild hypertension if they are in a high risk group, such as medical workers - and replacing them with alternative blood pressure-lowering drugs. The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) took the opposite tack, highlighting the drugs\u2019 potential in fighting coronavirus and recommending patients continue taking the drugs until more about the risks is known. Several of the scientists who co-authored it had done extensive, industry-supported research on antihypertensive drugs. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST Dr Kevin Kavanagh, founder of Health Watch USA, a patient advocacy organization, questioned whether scientists who are funded by the drug industry should be advising clinicians, given the high stakes. \u201cYou need to consider stepping back, and let others without a conflict of interest try to make a call,\u201d Kavanagh said. His organization recommends that doctors temporarily avoid putting new patients on the drugs and warn those currently on them to take extreme precautions to avoid virus exposure. Dr Scott David Solomon, a co-author of the NEJM article, conducts industry-financed research but said it has no influence on his position. \u201cNot only is there no compelling evidence that we should be discontinuing those medications, but there's reason to think that doing so might actually cause harm,\u201d said Solomon, who is the director of noninvasive cardiology at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. The lack of consensus leaves doctors to navigate the issue patient by patient. Alexander, of Johns Hopkins, is trying to strike a balance in his own practice. Patients with more severe blood-pressure problems may need to keep taking the medicines, he said, while patients with milder or newly diagnosed cases could instead take one of the \u201cliterally dozens\u201d of alternative hypertension treatments. \u201cRest assured,\u201d he said, \u201cthere are dozens of scientific teams working feverishly to put this question to bed.\u201d (Reporting by Deborah Nelson; Editing by Brian Thevenot) Tags Business Health Sci & Tech Neuer Inhalt Horizontal Line External Content Subscribe to the Swiss Connection on iTunes subscription form Form for signing up for free newsletter.

Irving Steinberg, University of Southern California (THE CONVERSATION) It has been barely a few weeks since the coronavirus was declared a pandemic. The pace at which the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread across the globe is jolting, but equally impressive is the speed at which scientists and clinicians have been fighting back. I am a pharmacotherapy specialist and have consulted on infectious disease treatments for decades. I am both exhilarated and worried as I watch the unprecedented pace and implementation of medical research currently being done. Speed is, of course, important when a crisis such as COVID-19 is at hand. But speed \u2013 in research, the interpretation and the implementation of science \u2013 is a risky endeavor. The faster science is published and implemented, the greater the chances it is unsound. Mix in the panic and stress of the current pandemic and it becomes harder to make sure the right information is communicated and adopted correctly. Finally, governing bodies such as the World Health Organization, politicians and the media act as sources of trustworthy messaging and policy making. Each step \u2013 research, interpretation, policy \u2013 has safeguards in place to make sure the right information is acquired, interpreted and implemented. But pace and panic are testing these safety measures like never before. Unprecedented pace The process of taking an idea from theory through testing and eventually toward implementation has been refined in modern times to make sure medical studies and publications are truthful and accurate. Once research is completed, investigators analyze their results and write a manuscript. They then submit it to a journal, where it is reviewed by experts in that field who assess whether the methods, analysis and conclusions are sound. If the paper is accepted, it is then further edited and published in a journal. From there, groups like the WHO, medical societies and government agencies evaluate this and other evidence-based information to decide whether to establish new recommendations or change previous ones. It normally takes from several months to more than a year to go from submission to publication. But the rush to publish during this pandemic has shortened the time from submission to online publication to one to two weeks in numerous cases. There has also been a huge increase in preprint publication \u2013 publishing studies online before they are adequately peer-reviewed \u2013 and these are a good example of the risk that comes with the rapid release of data. On March 17, French investigators posted a prepublication clinical paper online touting the successful use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients. Despite the media and government attention, the study was described by director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony Fauci as \u201canecdotal\u201d due to the poor study design. On April 3, the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, the sponsoring organization of the very journal posting this prepublished article, agreed and stated \u201c\u2026.the article does not meet the Society\u2019s expected standard,\u201d and \u201cAlthough ISAC recognises it is important to help the scientific community by publishing new data fast, this cannot be at the cost of reducing scientific scrutiny and best practices.\u201d The debate over the usefulness of hydroxychloroquine will likely continue until well-designed trials are completed. The deliberate steps of scientific investigation, followed by editorial scrutiny, are guardrails. When these are disrupted there is a real risk that policy organizations may make consequential mistakes in spite of good intent. When pace meets with panic Nothing better illustrates how trusted institutions can make misinformed recommendations than the recent fiasco over ibuprofen. The most common early symptom of COVID-19 is fever, and ibuprofen is one of the most widely used drugs in the world to treat fever. In a letter published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, European researchers raised concerns that ibuprofen use could worsen COVID-19 symptoms. The idea is that since ibuprofen increases the quantity of ACE2 in human cells \u2013 the protein that the coronavirus uses to enter lung cells \u2013 the virus could infect lung cells more easily if a person was on ibuprofen. This was not a study nor did it present sufficient experimental evidence; it was simply a theoretical concern based on a mechanism. Three days after the letter was published, the French health minister tweeted a message urging people to avoid ibuprofen for coronavirus associated fever based on four \u201ccited\u201d cases of people getting sicker after taking ibuprofen. These cases were never published in a journal. The French Health Ministry followed this with a broad ban on treating COVID-19 fever with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen. The WHO tweeted an essentially similar warning. The media followed with more case anecdotes, dubiously relating worsening early symptoms with ibuprofen use and referring to the letter as a \u201cstudy,\u201d adding to the confusion and fear. The Lancet letter also hypothesized that two other drugs commonly used to treat hypertension and diabetes \u2013 ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) \u2013 could be problematic in people with COVID-19. However, the mechanism they put forward was incompletely described and neglected that a protein these drugs promote can be helpful in reducing inflammation and tissue damage in the lungs and heart. The response This letter to The Lancet slipped past the safeguards in research and institutional and media interpretation, but one of science\u2019s oldest pastimes \u2013 definitively calling out the errors of others \u2013 reestablished patience and perspective. Clinicians and scientists pushed back swiftly, supporting the use of ibuprofen in COVID-19 patients. The support was outlined in a published literature review. In response, the WHO quickly reversed its position on ibuprofen. There was a similar rapid response to the statements about ARBs. Within days, three prominent cardiology groups, including the American Heart Association, released a joint statement urging practitioners not to discontinue ACE-I and ARBs in their patients. The risk-benefit ratio is always a clinical factor for the use of any drug in any patient. But the risk must be more than theory for the use of a drug to be discontinued or any major policy change to be implemented. Some perspective As the coronavirus rampages across the U.S., it is incredibly important to know whether commonly used drugs like ibuprofen or ARBs are risky, neutral or of therapeutic potential. There are ways to find out quickly. Researchers can look for correlations between the use of ibuprofen or ARBs and more severe infections or deaths, for example. And standard clinical trials can, should and are being done. There are several studies currently underway testing the effect and risk of ARBs for COVID-19 patients. But until the science is finished, it is foolish and potentially dangerous to flee from tested clinically important drugs. Scientists and policymakers must take quick steps and avoid missteps. Proper scientific method and conduct of studies, carefully reviewed publications and cogent post-release interpretations are necessary safeguards that ensure the best and safest medicines are prescribed and provided. The pressure and desperation of the moment are forcing researchers and policymakers to be innovative and act quickly, but what is done should stay within the guiding concepts of medical research.

The measures were put in place when the PHERMT met to discuss the public health preparedness against COVID-19 pandemic for the Accra Metropolis in line with the President\u2019s directive on measures to contain and prevent the spread of the disease in the country. A statement signed by Mr Gilbert Nii Ankrah, the Head of Public Affairs Department of the AMA and copied to the Ghana News Agency has said. It said the conduct of marriages at the AMA City Hall were limited to only the couples and witnesses (two from both the groom and the bride) and that all public gatherings and programmes at the Hall were suspended until further notice. Also, the Police has been directed to ensure strict compliance concerning public gatherings in the metropolis. The statement said all food vendors in the metropolis should provide handwashing facilities and observe hygienic standards per the Food Safety and Hygiene By-laws, 2017 of the Assembly. It said all public toilets in the metropolis were directed to provide handwashing facilities at their entrances under acceptable sanitation standards as prescribed in the Sanitation By-law, 2017 of the Assembly. \u201cDrivers should endeavour to disinfect their vehicles (seat, door handle) using the bleach solution (parazone) and provide handwashing facilities (veronica buckets, liquid soaps, hand sanitizers),\u201d the statement said. It said the Metro Information Services Department would intensify its public education on preventive measures in markets, communities and other public places, while the Public Affairs Unit of the AMA would provide daily updates through their social media handles and other information outlets. The Assembly entreated all to frequently wash their hands with soap under running water for 20 seconds, use hand sanitizers and cover their nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing. \u201cIf you experience symptoms, call the emergency lines immediately on 0509497700, 0558439868, 0552222005 or visit the nearest healthcare centre.

According to the WHO, Good hygiene is an important barrier to many infectious diseases, and it promotes better health and well-being. This has driven Dettol\u2019s commitment to spreading the message of good hygienic practices among Nigerians. Recently, the hygiene education team visited St Mary\u2019s Convent School, Lagos Island, Lagos, and over 500 school pupils were taught how to prevent the transmission of respiratory illnesses, and proper hand hygiene.

In light of the panic around Coronavirus, what we can do individually is to carry out preventive actions and constant hand washing is one of the most important ones in the fight against communicable diseases. RB is proud to partner with the Lagos State Government, and our goal is to reach 50,000 children in 20 local government areas of the state.\u201d Also speaking at the event, Special Adviser on Sustainable Development Goals, Lagos State Government, Mrs Solape Hammond, added that: \u201cThis is a year in which Lagos State Government has decided to focus on SDG6 and SDG3 which relate to the health and environment pillars. It is very important that sanitation and well-being are taken very seriously. \u201cNow with what is going on with Coronavirus, we know that it is a disease that is easily communicable, but the chances of its spread are greatly reduced when people wash their hands, so we are encouraging every Lagosian out there to adopt these hygienic practices.\u201d Vanguard Kindly Share This Story: Related All rights reserved.

Share: Written By: Zee Media Bureau Edited By: Ananya Das Updated: Apr 21, 2020, 22:12 PM IST Trending News The government on Tuesday issued detailed guidelines which states, local bodies and communities can adopt, to contain the spread of coronavirus COVID-19, especially in densely populated areas. These guidelines are created specifically for areas where toilets, washing or bathing facilities are shared. The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop\u00a0serious illness. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed of coronavirus disease. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva while coughing or discharge from the nose while sneezing. A person can protect themselves and others from infection by washing their hands frequently, not touching the face, coughing or sneezing into a handkerchief and wearing a mask. Guidelines on hygiene and sanitation in densely populated areas: 1. Preventive Measures: There is currently no cure available for COVID-19. The most effective way of containing the disease in densely populated areas, where common facilities such as bathrooms and toilets are shared, is to implement measures that can catalyse behaviour change and promote strict adherence to hygiene and sanitation practices. Simple precautions and interventions implemented in a coordinated manner at the community level, by volunteers and authorities can help control the spread of the disease. It is important that all patients in the community with ILI (Influenza-like Illness) symptoms such as fever, chills, dry cough, running nose etc. immediately report to the nearest ASHA/Anganwadi/ frontline worker. Aarogya Setu App for COVID-19: The Aarogya Setu app (available in 11 languages) will alert you if there are COVID cases near you, help you diagnose symptoms and get you medical support. 2. Face Cover for Everyone in the Community: All individuals must wear face covers at all times including children older than three years. Ensure everyone has access to 100% cotton reusable face covers and they know how to make and wear them properly. 3. Sanitation and Hygiene during HANDWASHING: Common use surfaces such as handles, knobs, doors etc. are a major source of disease spread in a community. It is recommended that foot-operated handwashing stations are installed at all public areas to enable residents to frequently wash their hands. Two designs for affordable and self-assembled handwashing stations are proposed. A third design is recommended for installation in all public/community toilets permanently. These handwashing stations will control the spread of the disease while reducing the amount of water used. To eliminate the use of soap, chlorine can be added to the water. 4. Sanitation and Hygiene during TOILET USE: Individuals must not defecate in the open and instead must use the toilet. The toilet must be kept clean after every use. Poorly used or maintained community toilets can serve as a major source of disease. To prevent infection caused by people who do not take proper precautions while using toilets, the following best practices must be observed. 5. Sanitation and Hygiene with DISINFECTANTS: Authorities and Volunteers: Clean streets, toilets and walls with chlorine-containing disinfectant by thorough floor mopping, spraying or wiping three times a day. The concentration of Chlorine-based Disinfectant Solution to be used: Authorities may consider spray cleaning of specific areas as needed. Authorities may consider providing an alternative to soap-based handwashing, using a chlorine-based hand rub solution, dispersed in controlled conditions in public areas. This measure will reduce the amount of water needed. * Distribution of cleaning disinfectants can be arranged by community health workers. *Individuals: Mix 2-3 spoons-full of Phenyl, Chlorine bleach or Lysol available in stores in 5-litre bucket of water and wipe the floor and other surfaces (chair, table, doorknob, switches, etc.) with this water, ensuring that the disinfectant lasts at least 2 minutes at a time on a surface. Additional Measures: a. Thoroughly wash fruit and vegetables before use b. Always clean milk bags and other packaged food items and related materials with soap water before use Note: Wastewater surveillance (regular testing of wastewater) can be used as an early warning tool, especially when social distancing measures are lifted. Intensive community outreach and awareness importance of washing hands frequently and social distancing 1. Undertake on 2. Co-manage and maintain 3. Ensure water availability 4. Continually replenish soap and disinfectants 5. Follow all precautions strictly and rigorously To ensure the sustainability of proposed interventions, authorities and volunteers must ensure the following: handwashing stations with communities to communities and sanitation staff to control the spread of disease 6.

We live in turbulent times. The world is in the midst of its worst public health crisis in a century - in the form of COVID-19, and there's no vaccine in sight. According to health experts, the nearest viable vaccine is at least 16-19 months away. While scientists continue to work on a vaccine, the World Health Organization (WHO) is stressing on the importance of precautions to halt the spread of the virus, which is now officially a pandemic. In India, till March 23, the virus has resulted in eight deaths and infected 450-plus people. Eight union territories (UT) and 19 states have gone into lockdown, with only essential services being permitted to work (remain open). And, from midnight (March 24), the government has also barred the operation of domestic airlines as a precautionary measure. On a personal level, public health officials have repeatedly stressed on the importance of social distancing. Maintaining a distance of three feet from anyone who's coughing or sneezing, staying indoors and not leaving your house, unless it is an emergency, and washing your hands frequently with an alcohol-based sanitiser, or soap and water. Brands, too, have joined the government in spreading the message. Only yesterday (March 23), a video posted on Bollywood actress Kajol\u2019s Twitter account caught our eye. In times like these, the only thing that matters is yours & your family's health. A soap, ANY soap is the best way to prevent the spread of COVID-19. And yes, use an alcohol-based hand-sanitizer when outdoors. My appeal to you all is to take the necessary precautions & stay safe! pic.twitter.com/gTWrCI6DxO\u2014 Kajol (@itsKajolD) March 20, 2020 The actress is the 'handwashing' ambassador, Lifebuoy soap, which is marketed by Unilever. In the video, she stresses on the importance of handwashing as a potent precaution against the Coronavirus and then tells the viewers to use any soap that they have. This, despite her being seen in advertisements for Lifebuoy. The post said, \u201cIn times like these, the only thing that matters is yours and your family's health. A soap, any soap, is the best way to prevent the spread of COVID-19. And yes, use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser when outdoors. My appeal to you all is to take the necessary precautions and stay safe!\u201d The fact that Kajol, a Lifebuoy ambassador, is telling people to use any soap, because safety is above brand preference, goes a long way in explaining the seriousness of the current situation. And, this isn\u2019t the first time when the Unilever soap brand has gone the distance to put people\u2019s safety above itself. In a print ad that first appeared in the Mumbai edition of Hindustan Times, it urged people to practise correct handwashing technique in light of the Coronavirus outbreak in China. Lifebuoy print ad The print ad caught many people\u2019s eye because it mentioned its competitors, which only emphasised how serious the brand was about its consumers\u2019 health, than the sale of its product. Also, social media has a funny way of remembering things that took place years ago. With the focus on handwashing as an effective precaution against the virus, a Lifebuoy ad from 2013 has resurfaced on social media.

Delays/Closings 199 Closing Alerts CORONAVIRUS 'Pandemic' scientist says his team has discovered potential cure for COVID-19 Dr. Jacob Glanville's team took antibodies used to neutralize SARS and used technology in their lab to adapt them to recognize COVID-19. Author: Kelly Hessedal (kfmb) Published: 9:12 PM EDT March 30, 2020 Updated: 8:09 PM EDT April 1, 2020 CALIFORNIA, USA \u2014 A California scientist and his team say they have found a potential cure for COVID-19. News 8 introduced you to Dr. Jacob Glanville of Distributed Bio a couple of weeks ago. He's one of the doctors featured in the Netflix show \"Pandemic.\" His team in the Bay Area has been working around the clock trying to come up with a drug to treat COVID-19. Monday he announced he believes they've found one. \"We are happy to announce we have completed the engineering and we have some very potent antibodies that can be effective against the virus,\" said Dr. Glanville. On Wednesday, during the daily White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing, Dr. Fauci was asked about Dr. Jacob Glanville\u2019s work with antibodies, and said he supports the concept of monoclonal antibodies.\u00a0 Dr. Fauci said the science is well established. Below is News 8 reporter Kelly Hessedal's extended interview with Dr. Glanville and the answers he gave on the potential cure: How did you come up with this potential cure? We took a series of five antibodies from around 2002 that were able to neutralize SARS. We were able to use technology in our laboratories to evolve those antibodies against SARS to adapt them to recognize COVID-19. We tried with five different antibodies because we weren\u2019t sure which one would work the best. All five worked so we have a pretty powerful tool chest available to us right now to produce a final therapeutic. Would the drug be a shot? Or a pill?\u00a0 We think we will be able to deliver it as a shot. We\u2019ve been deliberately trying to engineer extremely potent antibodies because if they\u2019re potent you need less material and then you could give it as an injection. Will you be doing the trials on sick patients in the United States?\u00a0 This is a conversation we\u2019re having with the United States government on exactly where the study is being done. We're also talking to the European Commission. We want to make sure when we\u2019re ready to release this we\u2019re ready to release it to the entire world. What is the next step? We are sending [the antibodies] to the military for confirmation testing and to Charles River Laboratories for safety and tox characterization. We\u2019ve partnered with two different companies that will help us scale up large batches of the antibody for production. We're in discussions to start humane phase one/two trials that would happen at the end of the summer. Pending good results - [if] we see the drug is safe and helpful means we could start releasing it for compassionate use in September. How excited were you when you guys realized all this hard work you put in may have really paid off? I have a remarkable team. It blows me away the endless amount of time they were able to invest in this. RELATED: Netflix's 'Pandemic' scientist is creating a drug to treat COVID-19 patients RELATED: 'We need you': Gov.

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) administrator Dr. Stephen Hahn told Breitbart News exclusively on Wednesday that his agency is working with private industry leaders to bring more antibody testing and promising potential plasma-based treatments for the coronavirus to the American public. First and foremost, Hahn told Breitbart News that mitigation\u2014the wide-scale social distancing Americans nationwide are enduring as most states that have governor-issued stay-at-home orders in place\u2014is working. \u201cFirst, big big issue I think that is important that you highlighted is that the most effective weapon we have against this virus right now, this horrible virus, is mitigation,\u201d Hahn said. \u201cJust a huge shoutout to the American people for their resiliency, and they\u2019re getting the job done here.\u201d Hahn added that the scientific data coming in from hotspots across the country is suggesting that the United States may be at or near the peak\u2014the top of the curve, so to speak\u2014and that as long as Americans stick with the social distancing a little bit longer, they will make it through the end of this. \u201cI am optimistic. You can never predict the future. I\u2019m a doctor and I realize that,\u201d Hahn said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you I am completely confident we will win this battle. We have done a great job with the mitigation efforts. We will win the day and I am cautiously optimistic that we may be near our peak. But time will tell. But I am certainly confident that with the measures we have in place right now we will defeat the virus.\u201d Hahn is a member of Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s White House Coronavirus Task Force and a top ally of Pence and President Donald Trump in battling the coronavirus plaguing the United States and the world right now. He is also an oncologist by profession, having practiced for many years nationwide at key institutions fighting cancer before President Trump appointed him to lead the FDA in late 2019\u2013a position to which the U.S. Senate confirmed him on a bipartisan basis with a 72-18 vote. The FDA, under Dr. Hahn\u2019s leadership, is working to bring a number of new products to combat coronavirus to the market safely and with the proper scientific data to back up their release. These products include a variety of potentially promising therapeutics to treat those infected with coronavirus fromn potentially promising prophylactics to prevent infection, to testing for the disease, and perhaps most importantly for antibody testing to determine if someone\u2019s immune system is already prepared to fight it. In Hahn\u2019s exclusive interview with Breitbart News on Wednesday afternoon, he explained a number of these that have received attention\u2014beginning with hydroxychloroquine, the longtime anti-malarial drug that has received enormous amounts of attention since President Trump first cited it as a promising possibility in the White House briefings. While hydroxychloroquine has gotten perhaps the most attention in the media, as some opponents of Trump have attacked it as unproven\u2014technically the FDA has not approved that drug, or any drug for that matter, to treat the novel coronavirus, since the virus is brand new to the world\u2014there are many other potential antiviral therapeutics that the FDA commissioner said are in clinical trials now. \u201cWith respect to treatments, we categorize this in a couple of different ways. The first is antivirals, meaning the drugs that could have a direct benefit against the virus. Hydroxychloroquine could be an example of that, but there\u2019s a number of trials\u2014a double-digit number of clinical trials out there for other agents as well including hydroxychloroquine. On hydroxychloroquine, there are preliminary data out there that suggests that it might be a benefit with or without the addition of another antibiotic called Azithromycin. There are number of clinical trials out there both for patients who are sick with COVID-19, but also what we call post-exposure prophylaxis. What that means is if you think you\u2019ve been exposed\u2013for example a healthcare worker taking the drug and seeing if it prevents you from getting the disease. There\u2019s a number of clinical trials on that as well. So we\u2019re looking at that and obviously those data will be very important for FDA\u2019s determination about the safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloroqine. Now, that being said, this is a drug that is approved by FDA for treatment of other diseases like lupus, and what we need to make sure of is there\u2019s adequate supply of that drug for lupus patients and patients that have approved indications by the FDA. We also want to make sure there\u2019s enough of this drug available in the event that a particular doctor wants to write a prescription for a patient. Where this sits right now, and I think it\u2019s a very appropriate place, is if a patient isn\u2019t eligible for a clinical trial or doesn\u2019t have one available, that really becomes an individual patient-doctor-family discussion. They have the information at hand, and FDA has some state-of-knowledge documents out regarding the risks and benefits. That information can guide physicians to make the best decisions for their patients.\u201d So while trials for hydroxychloroquine and other potentially promising therapeutic antiviral drugs are ongoing\u2014they have been stood up quickly by industry leaders\u2014doctors can, under the way the FDA has structured these matters, write a prescription for a patient with coronavirus for such drugs if the doctor decides they think it would be best for them, even though the FDA has not approved its usage for this purpose yet. The trials should come back soon, though, Dr. Hahn said, and there are many nationwide underway right now. \u201cWe don\u2019t run the trials. There are sponsors for the trials,\u201d Dr. Hahn said. \u201cWe give them a letter to proceed. We review the trials and make sure there\u2019s adequate protection of patients and that they\u2019re looking at endpoints that will give us information to make a decision about its safety and effectiveness, and then those sponsors run those trials around the country. There\u2019s a number you might have heard about in the press. There are some really great groups that are running trials right now. So that\u2019s how that works from an FDA perspective.\u201d Perhaps the most interesting part of Dr. Hahn\u2019s interview with Breitbart News was focused on potentially promising emerging convalescent plasma treatments whereby immunity developed in someone who has recovered from the coronavirus is transferred to someone who is sick. People who have recovered from coronavirus can donate plasma to the Red Cross or other blood banks\u2014and they can donate more frequently than normal blood donations\u2014and then scientists at drug companies take the plasma and transfer it and its immunity properties to a sick person. This kind of treatment, while not FDA-approved and still being studied, is available on a \u201ccompassionate use\u201d standard as of now\u2014and will eventually, when it gets up to scale, be available on an \u201cexpanded access\u201d basis. The FDA, Dr. Hahn said, is working with the various elements of the supply chain for such treatment to help scale it up. \u201cThis is really interesting, and there\u2019s some preliminary data that suggests this is of some benefit to patients in particularly reversing some of the lung effects of the COVID-19 virus,\u201d Dr. Hahn said when asked about convalescent plasma treatments in the works right now. \u201cSo, nothing proven yet, but some interesting and I think promising information. So what this is is if you\u2019re a person who has recovered from COVID-19 after you had it\u2014remember, the vast overwhelming majority of Americans who have had a COVID-19 illness will recover from it, and in fact there are probably people who have never had any symptoms who have recovered from it. Those folks, because they\u2019ve recovered\u2014the ones who have been exposed and have recovered, there\u2019s a lot\u2014what we would do, not us, but the blood collectors like Red Cross et cetera is take plasma, which is the protein part of the blood that has the antibodies in it. You take it from people who have had the disease and have recovered. Plasma can be donated several times a month, so it\u2019s not like a regular blood donation where you can only do once every couple months. So what you do is you take that, you process it and you make sure it\u2019s what we call pathogen-free\u2014that there\u2019s no virus in it\u2014and then what we do is you take that unit and give it to someone who\u2019s sick. About three weeks ago, FDA put out on our website that we were permitting this to be given to people on a compassionate use basis. So a number of hospitals around the country have done that\u2014they\u2019ve manufactured and done this. Last Friday, what we did was scale that program up to what we call Expanded Access. Through Red Cross and blood collectors, people who have recovered can donate plasma and then Red Cross will create that immuno-plasma and then a doctor at a hospital can order that for a patient. The major rate-limiting factor right now is donation. As we see more people recover, and they\u2019re far enough out from the illness, we\u2019ll be able to scale that up more.\u201d Even more interesting than the plasma treatments is what can be derived from them. Once the FDA and industry partners have convalescent plasma treatment up to scale so they deliver those treatments on an expanded access basis, they can then take the convalescent plasma and make a booster shot with a \u201cconcentrate dorm of the hyperimmune globulin.\u201d This could transfer immunity to people more effectively than just a plasma transfusion, and could be used as a treatment or as a prophylaxis\u2014to prevent infection\u2014and could help front line healthcare workers exposed to the virus regularly develop short-term immunity to power through it. \u201cThink of it as a concentrated form of convalescent plasma,\u201d Dr. Hahn said. \u201cWhat you would do is instead of having to take a unit of plasma, what you would be able to do is give a shot\u2014a concentrated form of the hyperimmune globulin. What will happen when the manufacturers starting ramping this up, and this is the next step after convalescent plasma, is it will be studied in another Expanded Access program, and we\u2019ll study the safety and effectiveness of it. Basically it\u2019s another way to transfer the immunity to people. One of the complications of this is it takes a lot of donors to actually create that, but this will be particularly for frontline healthcare workers and first responders who haven\u2019t been exposed and don\u2019t have antibodies against the virus. This is a bridge to a vaccine.\u201d Dr. Hahn brought some of this on convalescent plasma and potential hyperimmune globulin booster shots up with Fox News\u2019s Maria Bartiromo in a recent interview, but did not mention this next thing at the time. He told Breitbart News that another thing in the works right now from various drug companies are potential treatments using what are called \u201cmonoclonal antibodies\u201d as a potential treatment or prophylaxis as well. The beauty of the monoclonal antibodies route, unlike the hyperimmune globulin devised from convalescent plasma route, is that monoclonal antibodies doses can easily be made at a much greater scale to reach the general public again as a \u201cbridge until a vaccine is ready.\u201d \u201cOne thing I didn\u2019t mention in that previous interview was that there are all sorts of medically, manufactured by drug companies, antibodies that could help the immune system fight the virus\u2014we call these monoclonal antibodies,\u201d Dr. Hahn told Breitbart News. \u201cWe are working with a number of companies now to help them develop, scale up, and then helping them to the manufacturing of this\u2014hoping that that could also act as a bridge until a vaccine is ready. The good thing about those monoclonal antibodies is they can also be used as a prophylaxis, but the scalability\u2014the ability to generate more doses of this\u2014is even greater than the hyperimmune globulin, but same concept.\u201d Based on prior experience with respiratory viruses & on data from China, convalescent plasma \u2013 the plasma from the blood of recovered ", "label": 1, "Q0": "Q0", "c_score": "0.5674163704999999"}

Photo/ANI Plasma therapy of cured patients' blood can be used in fighting COVID-19: AIIMS Director ANI | Updated: Apr 12, 2020 16:01 IST New Delhi [India], April 12 (ANI): The blood of cured coronavirus patients can be used to treat COVID-19 patients, says Delhi AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria. \"Conversion plasma is a therapy that is being looked at as an option to treat the patients of COVID-19. If a coronavirus positive patient recovers, then he recovers by his body fighting the infection. To fight the infection, the body produces antibodies that stay in the blood,\" Dr Guleria told ANI on Sunday. He said this is the reason the doctors can ask the cured COVID-19 patients to donate their blood to another virus-infected patient to boost his immune system. \"If these antibodies are found to be in high amount in a person who has recovered from the coronavirus, we can ask him to donate his blood. From that blood, we take plasma which has a high concentration of anti-bodies. These antibodies can be transfused to another COVID-19 person, which boost the immune system of sick persons and fight the virus in a better manner,\" added Dr Guleria. The plasma therapy was used to deal with viruses like Ebola. It is now being tried in various institutes in India. \"If data suggests it is useful, we will use it in the near future,\" said Dr Guleria. The Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) on Saturday gave approval to Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) to treat COVID-19 patients with 'convalescent-plasma therapy,' which uses immune power gained by a recovered person to treat a sick person. SCTIMST comes under the Department of Science and Technology. \"Technically called convalescent-plasma therapy, the treatment aims at using immune power gained by a recovered person to treat a sick person. The Indian Council for Medical Research has given approval to SCTIMST for carrying out the novel treatment,\" said the Ministry of Science and Technology.

Author: Adam Smith Publish date: Apr 19, 2020 1:12 PM EDT As drug companies in the U.S. and around the world race to come up with treatments and therapies that could be used to combat Covid-19, Eli Lilly\u00a0 (LLY) - Get Report\u00a0has joined in, testing treatments in study and its portfolio that appear to have promise for patients.\u00a0 The drugmaker is currently looking at two products,\u00a0baricitinib, a\u00a0rheumatoid arthritis medication\u00a0sold under the brand name of Olumiant, and\u00a0LY3127804, a type of selective monoclonal antibody that's currently in early clinical study for tumor treatment. Other companies searching for possible treatments and vaccines include the U.S.' Gilead Sciences\u00a0 (GILD) - Get Report, Regeneron\u00a0 (REGN) - Get Report, Moderna\u00a0 (MRNA) - Get Report,\u00a0Emergent BioSolutions\u00a0 (EBS) - Get Report\u00a0and Japan's\u00a0Takeda\u00a0 (TAK) - Get Report\u00a0and Fujifilm\u00a0 (FUJIY) -- several of these medications were looked at in a comprehensive report in the Journal of the American Medical Association\u00a0that also mentioned baricitinib. But so far no therapy or cure has been proven effective for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and a vaccine is at least a year away, at best.\u00a0 Baricitinib is known as a type of janus kinase inhibitor, or JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, used for the autoimmune disease\u00a0rheumatoid arthritis. It has already been approved in the U.S. and dozens of other countries for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Picking up on the anti-inflammatory properties of the drug,\u00a0a British company called BenevolentAI used\u00a0artificial intelligence to find that baricitinib might help in also treating Covid-19 patients. Some research has suggested that a small but significant number of patients with severe Covid-19 may suffer from what's known vaguely as \"cytokine storm syndrome\" -- a kind of raging hyper-inflammatory response that ends up harming the body and is believed to play a role in a number of deaths from the virus.\u00a0 Now, baricitinib will be studied by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in an adaptive Covid-19 treatment trial. Results are expected in a few months.\u00a0 TheStreet\u00a0asked Patrik Jonsson, senior vice president of Eli Lilly and of Lilly Bio-Medicines about the treatments over email last week. The interview has been edited for clarity and length. TheStreet: Could you explain the role inflammation seems to play in the body's response to the disease and what that means for outcomes? Jonsson: Baricitinib is a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor. These molecules block how cells respond to some cytokines, which are proteins that allow cells to communicate with each other. Excess cytokines may cause inflammation: In\u00a0rheumatoid arthritis, joint inflammation may cause pain, swelling, and tenderness. Due to nonclinical evidence showing the drug\u2019s ability to help disrupt how cells respond to cytokines, it is believed that baricitinib may be capable of reducing or interrupting the passage of Covid-19 into target cells and inhibiting the JAK1- and JAK2-mediated cytokine release associated with the virus. Investigators are also exploring another hypothesis that baricitinib may be a potential Covid-19 treatment due to a possible antiviral effect. The hypothesis here is that the baricitinib would work as an inhibitor for the host-cell protein that may assist in viral reproduction. So, by inhibiting this host cell protein, baricitinib could mitigate viral propagation. However, inflammation plays a dual role in protecting the body from infections and in the case of Covid-19, it contributes to the cytokine storm. So we need to conduct randomized clinical trials to fully understand the benefit and risk of baricitinib in Covid-19. U.S. prescribing information includes boxed warnings regarding the use of baricitinib, including warnings about risk for developing serious infections, a risk that may be related to baricitinib\u2019s effects on the immune system.\u00a0 TheStreet: What types of patients do you suspect would most benefit from this type of anti-inflammatory therapy? Jonsson:\u00a0The\u00a0National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases will be investigating the efficacy and safety of baricitinib as a potential treatment for hospitalized patients diagnosed with Covid-19 in a population with moderate to severe disease. Overall, it\u2019s believed that baricitinib could provide the greatest benefit to hospitalized patients. TheStreet: It sounds like this is widely used already, so if it's viewed as effective, how quickly do you think it could be used to treat patients? Jonsson: The baricitinib arm of NIAID\u2019s Adaptive Covid-19 Treatment Trial will begin this month in the U.S. with a planned expansion to additional sites including Europe and Asia. It will investigate the efficacy and safety of baricitinib as a potential treatment for hospitalized patients. Results are expected within the next few months. We are also supporting select planned and ongoing multi-site and single-site investigator-initiated trials in Europe and North America for hospitalized patients with Covid-19 infections. In addition, we are aware that baricitinib is being tested by independent investigators. While we weren\u2019t approached for these particular trials, we look forward to understanding the data and patient outcomes from these independent studies. TheStreet: As for LY3127804, it was studied for tumor therapy, correct? Could you explain what role it would play as a therapy for Covid-19 patients with pneumonia? Jonsson: LY3127804, an investigational selective monoclonal antibody against Angiopoietin 2, is currently in a Phase 1 study in combination with (cancer drug) ramucirumab in people with advanced solid tumors. Angiopoietin 2\u00a0is known to be elevated in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients and Lilly will test whether inhibiting the effects of it with a monoclonal antibody can reduce the progression to acute respiratory distress or the need for mechanical ventilation in Covid-19 patients.... In the phase 2 clinical trial, LY3127804 will be tested in pneumonia patients hospitalized with Covid-19 who are at a higher risk of progressing to\u00a0acute respiratory distress syndrome. This study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of LY3127804 in participants who are hospitalized with pneumonia and presumed or confirmed Covid-19. The primary outcome measure is the number of ventilator-free days. The trial will begin later this month at several U.S. centers.

Over 1,650 articles on COVID-19 are already listed in databases such as Google Scholar, while dozens more are added daily. The register ClinicalTrials.gov lists over 460 ongoing clinical trials on COVID-19, although the majority are still in the earliest stages. Given the diversity of experimental approaches among these studies, a systematic review of possible clinical strategies is timely and welcome. In a new study in Frontiers in Microbiology, aimed at the research community but also comprehensible for non-specialists, experts from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill review possible strategies against dangerous coronaviruses - not only SARS-CoV-2 and its relatives such as SARS-Cov (causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS) and MERS-Cov (causing Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS), but also as yet unknown strains which will inevitably emerge in the future. They propose that the most promising approaches for fast progress are selected antivirals such as remdesivir, and gene therapy. \"Coronaviruses represent a true threat to human health and the global economy. We must first consider novel countermeasures to control the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic virus and then the vast array of high-threat zoonotic viruses that are poised for human emergence in the future,\" says Dr Ralph Baric, William R. Kenan, Jr. Distinguished Professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at UNC Chapel Hill. \"To help focus the global search for a treatment, we here aim to provide a comprehensive resource of possible lines of attack against SARS-Cov-2 and related coronaviruses, including the results from all preclinical and clinical trials so far on vaccines against SARS and MERS.\" The authors discuss one-by-one the possible strategies against the coronavirus. First, and most effective are vaccines. In the present case, the most successful are likely to carry the Receptor Binding Domain (of the virus's S-protein), which allows it to bind to and fuse with host cells. Besides the traditional live attenuated, inactivated, and subunit-based vaccines, modern types such as DNA/RNA-based and nanoparticle- or viral vector-borne vaccines should be considered. Because the amino acid sequence of the S-protein is very different across coronaviruses (e.g., 76-78% similarity between SARS-Cov and SARS-Cov-2), vaccines against one strain typically won't work against another. But because the development and testing of new vaccines takes one to several years, other approaches are essential in the meantime. The second-most likely effective are broad-spectrum antivirals such as nucleoside analogs, which mimic the bases in the virus's RNA genome and get mistakenly incorporated into nascent RNA chains, stalling the copy process. But because coronaviruses have a so-called \"proofreading\" enzyme which can cut such mismatches out, most nucleoside analogs don't work well. Exceptions seem to be \u03b2-D-N4-hydroxycytidine and remdesivir, proposed by the authors as good candidates against SARS-Cov-2. Third, convalescent blood plasma from patients who recovered, with low levels of a range of antibodies against the virus; or preferably (but slower to develop), monoclonal antibodies, isolated and mass-produced through biotechnology. Such \"passive immunization\" can give short-term immunity. The authors discuss a range of options from fusion inhibitors, to inhibitors of human proteases, to immune modulators such as corticosteroid hormones, and others. Finally, and in the authors' view the most attractive alternative until a vaccine is produced, is gene therapy delivered through the adeno-associated virus (AAV). This would entail the fast, targeted delivery of antibodies, immunoadhesins, antiviral peptides, and immunomodulators to the upper airways, to give short-term protection. Because the rapid turnover of cells here, risks of toxicity are minimal. They estimate that such tools can be developed, adapted, and tested within a month. \"AAV-based passive immunization can be used as a quick alternative. It is straightforward and only contains two components, the viral vector and the antibody. Multiple AAV vectors have been proven to be safe and effective for human use,\" says author Dr Long Ping Victor Tse. \"In theory, a single dose could mount a protective response within a week and last for more than a year. The currently high price could be reduced when treating infectious diseases, which have a larger market. It may or may not already be too late to use AAV to treat SARS-CoV-2, but it is certainly not too late for future outbreaks.\" Credit:\u00a0 Frontiers Link:\u00a0 http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00658 April 24, 2020 Science 2.0 Filtered Coffee Does Not Increase Lifespan Now Any More Than It Did Four Months Ago Coronavirus Is Not New, It's Been Evolving Along With Bats For Millions Of Years During COVID-19, The Death Rate After Going On A Ventilator Is The Same As For Other Issues A Tribute To Teresa Rodrigo The Biology Of Depression - Similarities In Suicide And Other Brains More We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect anonymous information.

Dr Rebecca Powell, assistant professor of medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, is actively gathering breast milk to study the antibodies. She put out an online call for volunteers in early April and says she\u2019s been inundated with responses\u2014right now there are about 900 women involved and she expects that number will continue to grow. \u201cThe hypotheses is generally that there would be antibodies in the milk against COVID-19 because there is some proportion of antibodies in milk that comes from blood,\u201d explains Dr Powell. \u201cWe hope that the antibody levels are high and have protective function. This is important for breastfed babies, obviously, Beyond that, if there are high levels of protective antibodies, those antibodies could be purified and used in treatments in severe cases of COVID-19,\u201d she said. She cautions that she\u2019s not talking about people buying breast milk off the Internet and drinking it: \u201cI\u2019m don\u2019t recommend anyone to buy bodily fluids online and ingest them. Any bodily fluid can also carry other illnesses. I\u2019m talking about purifying specific antibodies from the milk and using therapeutically.\u201d Dr. Powell\u2019s research is similar to\u00a0current studies on the antibodies of blood plasma, but the collection of breast milk is non-invasive and looks at a particular population\u2014lactating women. In terms of the volunteers Dr. Powell is looking for, she says, \u201cIf you are COVID-19 positive or you have strong reason to suspect you are infected or you are an essential worker with a high likelihood of infection, we are recruiting all over the country. Otherwise, we are recruiting any lactating mother in New York City whether they\u2019ve been tested positive, had exposure or not exposed at all.\u201d The women will pump, freeze their breast milk in their home freezer with the date and their name or initials on the bag. In time, Powell will work out a system for people to safely ship the milk to her lab. In NYC, she is personally coordinating no-contact pick-up of milk from mothers. \u201cObviously in science you want to reproduce things,\u201d says Dr Powell. \u201cBut in early experiments that I\u2019ve conducted in the last week, I\u2019m finding COVID-19-specific antibodies in the milk. These experiments need to be reproduced.\u201d She\u2019s hoping to receive full funding to continue this research for at least a couple of years. That doesn\u2019t mean that it would take years before the research could potentially help patients. \u201cIf I see high levels of antibodies in the milk, it could be acted on fairly quickly,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to work through the understanding of that with the FDA about how milk antibodies fit into emergency approval for therapeutics.\u201d Lactating mothers interested in participating in the research may contact Dr Powell for further information: [email\u00a0protected] Comments Please leave your comment below Post comment Most popular Most commented 1 Thomas Partey\u2019s dad sold possessions to buy him boots and get a visa to chase football dream 2 I'm surprised EC defied court order - Clara Beeri 3 How to cure piles permanently at home in 3 days 4 COVID-19: Allow Muslims to pray in groups this Ramadan- Akufo-Addo urged 5 SHOCKING VIDEO: Slay Queen strips off completely on Facebook Live to curse her ex-boyfriend for leaking her s*x tape 6 Kotoko had no right to demand solidarity fee for Gideon Baah- Chibsah 7 US nurse and family get healed of COVID-19 using herbs 8 Tell the truth or I expose you \u2013 Vim Lady warns Captain Smart over divorce saga 9 Would the EC have disqualified Mahama, Akufo-Addo over clerical errors? - Lawyer 10 Revealed: Don Bortey's first child is a footballer at the University 1 I Have Not Leaked NDC Secret - E.T.

Breastmilk and COVID-19 The University of California San Diego School of Medicine and the Family Larsson-Rosenquist Foundation (FLRF) are collaborating to launch studies into breastfeeding and breast milk as they relate to COVID-19. As part of a larger consortium, researchers will address two critical questions: Is COVID-19 transmitted via human milk? Can breast milk protect infants from COVID-19? We already know breast milk contains properties that help protect infants from diseases, such as diarrhea and pulmonary infections. We urgently need to determine whether or not the virus is found in breast milk and discover breast milk components with antiviral properties that could protect infants from COVID-19.\" Lars Bode, Ph.D., principal investigator and director of UC San Diego's Larsson-Rosenquist Foundation Mother-Milk-Infant Center of Research Excellence (MOMI CORE) FLRF is donating $100,000 in an expedited, streamlined process to assist researchers at MOMI CORE. \"This generous donation from FLRF will help us to mobilize immediately,\" said Bode, professor of pediatrics at UC San Diego School of Medicine. \"We have been establishing top-level research resources around the world over the past five years, and now, with that infrastructure in place, we and our research partners are better prepared to respond to emergency situations in an agile manner,\" said G\u00f6ran Larsson, chairman of the FLRF Board. \"We are proud to support MOMI CORE's work, and hope others can do the same.\" In a concerted effort with other human milk research labs, MOMI CORE is developing sample collection protocols and assays to determine whether or not the virus is present in breast milk. These technologies will be available for clinical studies planned at UC San Diego and elsewhere. In parallel, MOMI CORE is teaming up with UC San Diego virologists and infectious disease specialists to screen breast milk components for their potential antiviral properties. \"We have very limited data on how breastfeeding and human milk bioactives impact COVID-19, but we need to find out to help stop the pandemic,\" said Bode. \"In these extraordinary times, health professionals need reliable information to both protect the practice of breastfeeding and ensure the health of breastfeeding mothers and their children.\" Pregnancy and COVID-19 Another new and related study with researchers at UC San Diego School of Medicine involves a newly launched effort to examine the short-and long-term effects of the novel coronavirus in pregnancy and breastfeeding. The observational study is being conducted by the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS), the professional scientific society that includes the MotherToBaby service, which provides evidence-based information on the safety of medications and other exposures during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

However, prior research on respiratory infections, such as seasonal influenza, has indicated that pregnant women in general are at higher risk than non-pregnant women for complications from the infection, which in turn can lead to more common pregnancy complications, such as preterm delivery. In addition, a high fever early in pregnancy may pose a risk for the developing fetus, and women should discuss treatment options with their health care provider.\" The study will recruit pregnant women who reside anywhere in the United States or Canada. Mothers will be interviewed by telephone over the course of their pregnancy and postpartum period and will be asked to release relevant medical records from their health care providers. This information will be used to assess the course of pregnancy and outcomes for both mother and the infant. Researchers will also track infant growth and development, via the child's pediatrician, for at least one year. This work will be coordinated with other efforts being initiated throughout the U.S. and other countries. Additionally, women who are breastfeeding and come into contact with COVID-19 will be asked to enroll in UC San Diego's Human Milk Biorepository, a related study of breastmilk. Using a common protocol developed in coordination with MOMI CORE, breast milk and infant samples will be collected along with an interview regarding the mother's symptoms and treatments, as well as information on the growth and developmental outcomes of the breastfed infant or toddler. \"We hope pregnant and breastfeeding women see the importance in helping the world understand this novel virus and consider volunteering for the study. There is much to be learned in a short period of time that can help women who are currently or may become pregnant or breastfeed,\" said Chambers, director of clinical research for the Department of Pediatrics. Pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers can learn more about the study or how to enroll by visiting mothertobaby.org/join-study or by calling MotherToBaby at 877-311-8972.

(Westend61/Getty Images) HEALTH Coronavirus With a Baby: Here's What Parents Need to Know KARLEEN GRIBBLE & NINA JANE CHAD, THE CONVERSATION 13 MARCH 2020 If you have a baby, you may be worried about them catching the coronavirus, particularly after media reports of an Australian infant diagnosed with it. The good news is, the evidence so far is babies almost never get seriously ill from the coronavirus. And even if infected, they may have no symptoms. \u00a0 However, the coronavirus could affect infants in other ways. For instance, there may be difficulties accessing health care, consumer goods and child care. Thinking about these possibilities now, and preparing for them, can help you manage what may come. Health care access may be tricky, but there are ways If the coronavirus becomes widespread, the health system will struggle to cope for a while. Up to 20 percent\u00a0of people who get COVID-19 need treatment in hospital for up to two weeks or more. Hospitals and general practices may be overwhelmed by others sick with the coronavirus, which may make it difficult to access health care if your baby gets sick for any reason. Recognising this, the Australian government recently announced special provisions for parents of newborns to be bulk-billed when consulting a doctor or nurse via phone or video call rather than in person. There are also things you can do to help keep your baby healthy so they don't need medical treatment. By protecting them, you also protect the people around them who may be more vulnerable to serious illness from the coronavirus. \u00a0 Think about hygiene The first thing you can do is to practice good hygiene yourself. This includes frequently washing your hands, avoiding close contact with other people as much as you can, coughing or sneezing into your bent elbow or a tissue, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Because babies put their hands in their mouths no matter what, frequently washing their face and hands and cleaning surfaces and objects they might touch will help protect them from any infection. How about daycare? It will come as no surprise to most parents that babies who attend daycare are sick more often. That's because babies and small children have an immature immune system, are in very close contact with one another, and may end up sharing saliva with one another by mouthing and touching one another and the same toys. So, if you can, keep your baby away from daycare. However, if you need to use it, when you pick up your baby from daycare, wash their hands and face, change their clothes, then wash your own hands, before scooping them into that big, warm hug. \u00a0 Make sure vaccinations are up to date Routine vaccination is the safest, most effective way to protect babies and children from illness. So, keep your child's vaccinations up-to-date to minimise the chance they'll need medical attention while the health system is dealing with the coronavirus. If you're breastfeeding Breast milk contains many ingredients to help prevent and fight infection. It is recommended babies be fed only breast milk until they are six months old and continue breastfeeding with other foods into their second year of life. If your baby is under six months and breastfeeding, offering them only breast milk protects them from a range of infections and reduces their need for medical treatment or hospitalisation. If your baby is breastfeeding and using formula, consider replacing formula feeds with breastfeeds. If you have stopped breastfeeding altogether, it is possible to start breastfeeding again if you want to (contact the national Breastfeeding Helpline for assistance). If you have an older baby or toddler who is still breastfeeding, keeping breastfeeding will help protect them from other illnesses until after the coronavirus pandemic has passed. \u00a0 If you're using formula It is easy to accidentally introduce germs into bottles while you're preparing infant formula. So, because medical care may be hard to access, it is worth taking extra care to prevent this. Be extra careful about preparing bottles. This means always washing your hands thoroughly with soap, washing bottles thoroughly, sterilising them after every use, and making up formula with hot water. Remember to cool down the bottle in the fridge, give it a gentle shake, and check it's not too hot before giving it to your baby. Shop for supplies, such as nappies Supply chains may be disrupted if lots of people get ill. And you may not be able to shop if you need to self-isolate at home. It is recommended you have two to three weeks worth of supplies at home to prepare for this possibility. Consider stocking up on nappies for this length of time, or keeping washable (cloth) nappies on hand. If you are formula feeding, buy enough infant formula for three weeks but check the expiry dates. What if mum contracts the coronavirus? Mothers are more at risk of becoming sick from the coronavirus than their babies. And if you're breastfeeding and you're infected, it is recommended you continue breastfeeding. That's because the virus has not been found in breastmilk. Wearing a mask when you are with your baby (including during feeding), washing hands before and after contact with your baby, and cleaning and disinfecting surfaces and any feeding equipment will help prevent your baby catching the virus from you. If you are are hospitalised or separated from your baby, you can express breastmilk for them. Think about keeping grandparents safe If you or your partner get ill, someone else may need to help care for the baby or other children. Babies like to share their saliva with their caregivers and they may be infected with the coronavirus but have no symptoms. So they may easily spread the infection to the people looking after them. Many parents call on grandparents to help with child care. Unfortunately people over 60 are the most likely to get seriously ill or die from the coronavirus. So, if your standby carers are over 60, now is the time to think about making alternate childcare arrangements. Talk with grandparents about how they can reduce their risk of infection if they need to look after the baby.

Rebecca Powell, a human milk immunologist, researcher, and assistant professor at The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, is researching whether or not antibodies found in breast milk can protect against the novel coronavirus. While studies have already proven that breast milk has a number of benefits for babies' immune systems \u2014 helping to ward off a number of diseases and infections both during breastfeeding and after being weaned \u2014 it's less clear if it could protect against coronavirus. In an effort to examine breast milk's potential to protect against COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus currently infecting millions of people around the world, Powell is looking to obtain breast milk samples from women living in New York City, a hot spot for the virus, or who have been confirmed to have had the virus. Powell told VICE News that she intends to check each sample she receives for COVID-19 antibodies to determine if the supplier was infected or exposed to the virus. Next she'll determine how many antibodies are present, what classes they are, how resistant they are, and, finally, whether they have the ability to fight off the novel coronavirus. Romper has reached out to Powell for additional comment. While Powell's research will likely take time to complete, Dr. Sharon Donovan, president of The International Society for Research on Human Milk and Lactation and the Melissa M. Noel Endowed Chair at the University of Illinois' Department of Food Science and Nutrition, tells Romper there's \"a biological plausibility\" COVID-19 antibodies will be present in the breast milk of women infected with the virus. \"In particular to COVID, if a woman is infected her body will produce antibodies to COVID and those antibodies will be passed into milk, so there is a biological plausibility that antibodies to COVID will be in human milk,\" Donovan, who is not affiliated with Powell or her research, says. While scientists like Powell are working toward studying breast milk for coronavirus antibodies, there's currently no concrete proof that drinking breast milk can cure or protect adults from the novel coronavirus. That lack of proof, however, reportedly hasn't stopped some individuals from buying breast milk online in hopes that drinking it might boost their immune system. According to a report from The Daily Beast, milk sellers from around the country have reported an increase in interested buyers looking to personally consume breast milk on the off chance it can protect them against coronavirus. News of the trend has some doctors advising caution. \"First of all, should adults be buying breast milk on the internet? No,\" Donovan tells Romper. \"Second, there\u2019s really no good evidence that adult humans drinking human milk will in general improve their immunity.\" Dr. Dyan Hes, the medical director of Gramercy Pediatrics in New York City, echoed a similar message in an interview with CBS News, telling the network such claims were hypothetical. \"There is no proof that breast milk, at all, can cure COVID or give you antibodies. There is no data that I know of that has been published about it.\" In fact, Donovan tells Romper that adults looking to boost their immunity by drinking breast milk bought online could end up endangering themselves. While very limited early research has suggested that COVID-19 does not transmit through breast milk, Donovan notes that other viruses have been found to pass into breast milk. \"We do know that other viruses like HIV and Cytomegalovirus and other viruses could be in human milk, so you could put yourself at risk of getting other diseases,\" she tells Romper. \"You also don't know, does that person take pharmaceutical drugs for health, do they smoke, do they drink, do they take drugs of abuse. Any of those things can pass into human milk.\" While milk purchased for babies from a milk bank is screened to ensure safety, many doctors as well as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have strongly recommend against buying milk online from public websites or sellers due to the potential for dangerous bacteria. What's more, a 2013 study from researchers at Nationwide Children's Hospital found that more than three-fourths of the breast milk samples bought online contained illness-causing bacteria and evidence of poor collection, storage, and shipping. Even Powell told VICE News that, should antibodies in breast milk be found to have protective capabilities against the novel coronavirus, the milk wouldn't be served up directly in a glass. Instead, the antibodies found in the milk would have to be purified and then transfused. As for drinking breast milk to boost your immune system? \"I would not recommend that,\" Hes told CBS News. \"I think you could take some Vitamin C and Zinc if you want to but do not buy breast milk to prevent COVID, that is not going to help you, no.\" Powell told VICE News she's received significant interest from breastfeeding mothers eager to donate their milk and that she plans to collect samples for a year or more. If you think you\u2019re showing symptoms of coronavirus, which include fever, shortness of breath, and cough, call your doctor before going to get tested. If you\u2019re anxious about the virus\u2019s spread in your community, visit the CDC for up-to-date information and resources, or seek out mental health support.

Now, rumors are spreading that breast milk could contain COVID-19 antibodies, but doctors say there\u2019s no evidence to support that claim. \u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s no proof that breast milk at all can cure COVID or give you antibodies,\u201d Dr. Dyan Hes, a pediatrician with New York City\u2019s Gramercy Pediatrics, told CBSN\u2019s Anne-Marie Green and Vladimir Duthiers on Tuesday. \u201cThere\u2019s no data that I know of that has been published yet about it.\u201d\u00a0 For years, people have been selling and buying human breast milk online for adult consumption, touting its supposed benefits as a \u201csuperfood\u201d with immune-boosting properties. These claims have been repeatedly debunked by doctors, who say drinking breast milk as an adult has no health benefit and can lead to a number of illnesses.\u00a0 Despite these warnings,\u00a0The Daily Beast reports that milk sellers have seen an increase in buyers looking for human milk to boost their immunity or speed up their recovery. While breast milk is good for an infant\u2019s developing immune system, Hes warns that there is a lack of evidence to support the existence of coronavirus antibodies in breast milk. \u201cThere\u2019s no proof of that yet, this is all hypothetical,\u201d she said. \u201c[Breast milk] would be the lowest thing on my list. I think you can take some vitamin C and zinc if you want to, but do not buy breast milk to prevent COVID. That is not going to help you.\u201d\u00a0 There is some research being done on the subject. Dr. Rebecca Powell, an infectious disease expert at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, put out a call on\u00a0social media for breast milk to test for antibodies and their potential ability to combat the disease. However, the research could take months or years, and Powell explained to VICE that if any potential treatment could be derived, the antibodies would need to be purified and concentrated \u2014 not just drunk.\u00a0 Other research is looking into whether\u00a0antibodies found in the blood of people who recovered from the virus could be used to help treat people who are sick. Antibodies from recovered COVID-19 patients could be key to fighting virus Crucially, there has been no detection of the virus itself in breast milk, meaning there is no known risk of an infected mother passing it to her child through milk. This is consistent with other respiratory illnesses like SARS. Hes said that doctors are encouraging mothers who have tested positive but want to breastfeed their babies to wear a mask and gloves every time they pick up their child. If they are pumping, they are encouraged to do so under very clean conditions with frequent hand washing, and have someone else feed the baby. Both methods are supported by both the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Weather Alert 4 Weather Alerts VERIFY VERIFY: Fact-checking this week's viral coronavirus claims The VERIFY team is compiling its fact-checks weekly on the new illness known as COVID-19, here's March 6. Author: VERIFY, Jason Puckett (TEGNA), David Tregde, Terry Spry Jr. Published: 6:37 PM CST March 6, 2020 Updated: 6:37 PM CST March 6, 2020 Fears regarding the outbreak of the coronavirus, officially named COVID-19, have led to rumors circulating online, a lot of them. So many in fact that VERIFY is compiling each week\u2019s coronavirus fact-checks every Friday. That way you can easily find every fact-check the team has made about the coronavirus on a weekly basis. Here are this week\u2019s viral claims. It\u2019s possible the coronavirus could live on phones for up to four days The World Health Organization made a report on SARS in 2003 that found it could survive on glass for up to four days. Most modern phones have screens made of glass. Both the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have compared the newest coronavirus, COVID-19, to SARS because it was also a coronavirus. So based on what we know about SARS, it\u2019s possible that the virus could survive on your phone for up to four days. So, be sure to sanitize your phone from time to time, especially if you let another person use it. ARTICLE: VERIFY: Coronavirus can live on a phone for 4 days You can make homemade hand sanitizer, just don\u2019t use vodka for it Several news articles shared recipes for homemade hand sanitizers you could make yourself. These recipes are roughly similar to a recipe the WHO shared about 10 years ago. The most important aspect of these recipes is that they\u2019re at least 60% alcohol, according to the CDC. The issue with using liquor, such as Tito\u2019s Vodka, in these recipes is that they don\u2019t have enough alcohol to be effective. ARTICLE: VERIFY: Yes, it's possible to make homemade hand sanitizer Hand sanitizers can help protect you from the coronavirus, just not as well as washing your hands will A viral tweet claimed that hand sanitizers won\u2019t help protect you from COVID-19 at all. This isn\u2019t true. While the CDC recommends people wash their hands with soap and water as the best preventative measure for COVID-19, they say you should use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if washing your hands isn\u2019t an option. ARTICLE: VERIFY: Hand sanitizer can protect against coronavirus, but not as well as washing your hands A flu vaccine cannot double as a coronavirus vaccine A viral clip of a question President Donald Trump asked a team of doctors at a meeting prompted clarifications about vaccines and how they work. According to the CDC, vaccines build up the body\u2019s immune system by putting weakened or dead forms of a pathogen into the body. This typically only helps the body build immune responses to specific viruses and bacterias or specific strains of viruses and bacterias. That\u2019s part of the reason it\u2019s recommended you get a flu vaccine every year -- each flu vaccine only protects you from specific strains that research believes will be common that year. Given that the flu vaccine only protects against specific strains of the influenza virus, it would have no impact on the coronavirus. ARTICLE: VERIFY: Trump comments on coronavirus vaccine development prompts need for clarification Antibiotic cream won\u2019t protect you from the coronavirus Claims of home remedies and unproven preventative measures have circulated online since the outbreak of COVID-19 first began. One such claim is that you can prevent yourself from getting the coronavirus if you rub antibiotic cream in your nostrils. Antibiotics kill bacteria, not viruses, so an antibiotic cream would not have any effect on the coronavirus. In general, don\u2019t trust claims about treatments or remedies unless they come specifically from the CDC or the WHO.

After this recommendation of DIY hand sanitizer, there\u2019s been a surge of articles online touting how you can make your own at home. Apparently, all you need is vodka and rubbing alcohol, plus a few other things. But keep in mind that not all vodka is created equal. Austin-based Tito\u2019s Vodka has apparently spent the last 24 hours informing people on social media that its spirits do not contain high enough concentrations of alcohol to properly ward off germs, Dallas News reports. \u201cPer the CDC, hand sanitizer needs to contain at least 60% alcohol. Tito\u2019s Handmade Vodka is 40% alcohol, and therefore does not meet the current recommendation of the CDC,\u201d Tito\u2019s Vodka tweeted.

More is said to be on the way, although it's not clear how long it will take retailers to restock.

Hydrogen peroxide is added using the measuring cylinder. Glycerol is added using a measuring cylinder. As glycerol is very viscous and sticks to the wall of the measuring cylinder, it should be rinsed with some sterile distilled or cold boiled water and then emptied into the bottle/tank. The bottle/tank is then topped up to the 10-liter mark with sterile distilled or cold boiled water.\u00a0 The lid or the screw cap is placed on the tank/bottle as soon as possible after preparation, in order to prevent evaporation. The solution is mixed by shaking gently where appropriate or by using a paddle. Place the solution in quarantine for 72 hours before use. This allows time for any spores present in the alcohol or the new/re-used bottles to be destroyed.

Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email Until a vaccine is developed to protect us against Covid-19, there are only two ways to \u00adprotect \u00adourselves \u2013 slowing the spread of the virus with regular hand-washing and social distancing, and strengthening our immune systems to minimise symptoms and complications if it does hit. Myths and misinformation about the new virus are spreading rapidly, but there are some simple evidence-based steps we can take to protect ourselves. Our immune system works on two levels \u2013 innate immunity, which is like the walls of a fortress and the troops which defend against all threats; and \u00adadaptive immunity, which consists of the commandos and special forces we deploy to counter a specific attack. Professor Adrian Martineau, an expert in respiratory medicine and immunology at Queen Mary University of London, explains: \u201cInnate immunity is basically a package of measures we are born with, that work against all bacteria and viruses in a generic way. At its most basic, our skin is part of this innate immune system because it stops bugs getting inside us.\u201d Coronavirus (Image: Getty Images/Image Source) Read More Related Articles Coronavirus: Madrid ice skating rink to be turned into temporary morgue Read More Related Articles Coronavirus: Distraught paramedic unable to buy food for family because of huge queues This in-born immunity also works at a cellular level, triggering the release of infection-fighting chemicals and other responses to counter the threat. Prof Martineau says: \u201cOur adaptive immune system works by developing a specific immunity when it encounters a virus or bacterium \u2013 and we can mimic this by giving a vaccine.\u201d And while there is very little research looking specifically at Covid-19, there are studies exploring innate and adaptive immunity which point to sensible \u00adstrategies to boost our defences and help us stay well. D for defence (Image: Getty Images) It may be no accident that most cases have occurred in the Northern \u00adhemisphere, where we are coming out of winter and many people will be short of vitamin D. Studies have linked low levels of vitamin D to an increased risk of \u00adrespiratory infections, and laboratory tests confirm the sunshine vitamin \u00adinfluences innate and adaptive immunity. A research team led by Prof Martineau analysed 25 trials, with 11,321 \u00adparticipants, and found taking a vitamin D supplement protected against acute respiratory \u00adinfections \u2013 and those with the lowest levels were the most likely to benefit. What are the symptoms of coronavirus? The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are: a dry, persistent cough a fever If you experience these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate yourself for seven days. It is not necessary to call NHS 111 unless your symptoms get more severe. Some patients have reported fatigue,\u00a0headaches, shortness of breath and aches and pains. Sneezing is not a symptom of the coronavirus. Prof Martineau says: \u201cWe obviously have no evidence with Covid-19, and results of trials looking at vitamin D and the risk of other respiratory infections are inconsistent. Some show protection, but others found no benefit. Overall, I would say that taking a vitamin D supplement is not going to hurt and there is some reason to think there might be a benefit.\u201d The amount we can make from sunshine is still minimal, and there are only a few foods \u2013 including eggs, \u00admushrooms, oily fish and red meat \u2013 which contain small amounts. Some breakfast cereals, spreads and yogurts are also fortified with vitamin D. The NHS advice is that everyone over the age of one \u201cshould consider taking a supplement containing 10mcg of vitamin D, particularly during autumn and winter\u201d. If your \u00adpharmacy or \u00adsupermarket has sold out, some \u00admulti-vitamins will provide the recommended amount. Follow your gut Fruit & vegetables (Image: Getty) Read More Related Articles Coronavirus: Morrisons' 'loophole' for shoppers who can't get delivery slots There are more bacteria in our gut than there are cells in our body, and everyone has a unique mix of good and bad bacteria, which has a huge impact on our immune system. This microbiome is also one of the reasons a diet high in fruit and vegetables boosts defences. Apart from providing immune-strengthening \u00adnutrients and polyphenols, fruit and vegetablesare rich in fibre \u2013 which feeds friendly gut bacteria. Studies show a high-fibre diet strengthens anti-viral immunity and reduces \u00adinflammatory damage to the lungs, which would be useful against Covid-19. Analysis of 83 studies confirms a diet high in fruit and vegetables reduces airway inflammation and raises levels of white blood cells which specifically target viral infections. Probiotic yogurts and drinks also cut the risk of upper respiratory tract \u00adinfections, with most research focusing on bifidobacteria and lactobacillus. One study showed probiotics reduced the duration of \u00adinfections by around two days. If you have taken antibiotics in the past six months, probiotics are a useful way to replace the friendly bacteria these \u00admedicines destroy. Also, we should all cut back on alcohol, highly processed foods, and foods which are laden with sugar and saturated fats because these weaken our defences by \u00adprompting the growth of unhealthy gut bacteria.

A 12-week study of 1,002 adults found those who do aerobic \u00adexercise five or more times a week reduce their risk of respiratory tract infections by 43%. Anything that makes you breathless and gets your heart racing will help \u2013 but avoid very prolonged workouts and endurance events as these weaken immunity. A third of marathon runners catch respiratory tract infections within a \u00adfortnight of an event, compared to one in seven non-competitors. Rest easy Brunette woman by the sea brething fresh air They say sleep is the best medicine, and dozens of studies have \u00adunderlined its importance for immunity. When we sleep there is a rise in infection-fighting proteins called cytokines, as well as hormones and other body chemicals which repair damaged cells. A study published last year reported that sleep makes T-cells, a type of lymphocyte, which plays a central role in the immune response, more \u00adeffective more efficient at targeting and destroying viruses. Professor Russell Foster, an expert in sleep and health, based at Oxford \u00adUniversity advises: \u201cEnsure the bedroom is a place that promotes sleep. Don\u2019t text, use a computer or watch TV for at least half an hour before trying to sleep and avoid bright lights. Try not to nap during the day, seek out natural light in the morning to adjust the body clock, and avoid drinking caffeinated drinks after your lunch.\u201d C sense Studio portrait of blonde woman drinking orange juice Read More Related Articles Coronavirus: Severely obese people 'warned to self isolate' as measures kick in Read More Related Articles Woman's three-step slow cooker recipe for making bread if you can't find any in shops Vitamin C is important for immunity, but there is little evidence that high-dose supplements protect against infection. The common cold is caused by \u00adrespiratory viruses, and researchers who analysed 29 studies involving 11,306 people, concluded taking vitamin C \u00adsupplements \u201cis not justified\u201d. However, they found a daily dose of 200mg of vitamin C reduces the duration of colds by 8%. As vitamin C is water soluble and cannot be stored, it should be taken as a series of frequent lower doses. High doses lead to a brief spike in blood levels before the excess is excreted via urine. A 100ml glass of fresh orange juice provides the 40mg a day \u00adrecommended by the NHS, but if you are buying juice from concentrate, apple has slightly more \u2013 49mg per 100ml, compared to 31mg in orange juice. Keep calm and carry on It\u2019s natural to be worried about Covid-19, but try not to stress because that could \u00adundermine your immune system.

Zinc about it One in 12 adults is putting immunity at risk by not getting enough zinc. The mineral, which is found in shellfish and dairy foods, has been proven to reduce the risk of \u00adinfections and stall the replication of viruses. A 2017 super-study, which looked at all published evidence, found taking zinc within 24 hours of the first symptoms reduced the duration of colds by a third. Doses used in the trials ranged from 80mg to 207mg a day. Root it out Echinacea is promoted as an immune-boosting remedy, however, the results of published studies are far from conclusive. Dr Chris Etheridge, a medical herbalist and president of the College of Practitioners of Phytotherapy, says this is largely because so many different species, parts of the plant, \u00adproduction methods and concentrations are used. He says: \u201cLooking at trials, there is good evidence for Echinacea angustifolia, and preparations made from the root have shown superior results.

With the outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus in the United States, and the uncertainty around it, Americans are looking for ways to improve their chances of not contracting the disease and to stay healthy during isolation. Heavy spoke with Dr. Donald Boyd, an oncologist, hematologist, and nutritionist at Yale Medicine and physician at Smilow Cancer Hospital Care Center. He shared recommendations for ways that Americans can attempt to raise their immune system. It is important to note that these are recommendations, and as per Harvard Medical School, \u201cThere is still much that researchers don\u2019t know about the intricacies and interconnectedness of the immune response. For now, there are no scientifically proven direct links between lifestyle and enhanced immune function.\u201d Heavy reiterates that individuals should always consult their local physician or health care professional before making changes to their diets.\u00a0 Maintaining a Healthy Diet Is Key for Your Immune System & Overall Health Dr. Boyd told Heavy that having a healthy, balanced diet is key to building and maintaining a healthy immune system. The best way to get adequate nutrients is through eating properly. He acknowledged that diets are very individualized and depend on each person. In this situation with the coronavirus, many people may be stocking up on dry foods like spaghetti and macaroni, but Americans should remember to eat fruits, vegetables and lean meat. He also said that Americans should avoid consuming high levels of sugar. Because a lot of Americans are probably living a more sedentary lifestyle due to isolation measures, it\u2019s even more important that they eat a healthy, balanced diet to avoid their health declining. Dr. Boyd said that this is a great time for individuals to focus on optimizing their diets and their family\u2019s health by learning more about nutrition. Physical Activity Is Extremely Important Dr. Boyd made it clear that people need to \u201cstop looking for magic bullets\u201d in dietary supplements. Individuals should focus on health, specifically eating well and being physically active. He told Heavy, \u201cWhen people ask me what to take, I tell them to take a walk.\u201d He reiterated that individuals need to abide by social distancing rules if they do go outside for physical activity. Individuals should also follow state and city guidelines in terms of leaving their homes. People can also work out in their home, and YouTube is a great resource for learning different, functional exercises that don\u2019t require a gym or equipment. Vitamins & Dietary Supplements May Help Boost the Immune System Dr. Boyd spoke to Heavy about different vitamins and supplements that may help boost and maintain someone\u2019s immune system. It is important to consult a pharmacist before purchasing and taking new vitamins. Multivitamins He said that if people aren\u2019t able to get an adequate level of nutritious whole foods, or if they suffer from ailments like a gastrointestinal disease, a multivitamin may work. \u201cProbably a smart thing to do [is to take] one [multivitamin] a day, or one every three days,\u201d he told Heavy. He doesn\u2019t believe that people need high doses of multivitamins. He said, \u201cThere are a lot of people promoting very high doses. I don\u2019t agree with it, and there\u2019s virtually no data that actually supports that.\u201d If an individual is eating a healthy diet, they may not need to take a multivitamin. But if someone isn\u2019t sure that they are getting an adequate level of nutrients, taking a multivitamin won\u2019t hurt. Vitamin D3 Dr. Boyd also said that Americans should maintain adequate levels of vitamin D. He cited the VITAL Study, which is a study that, in his words, \u201cpeople who sell vitamins don\u2019t like.\u201d The VITAL Study reinforces multiple other studies about vitamin D. It found that the OMEGA-3 fatty acid supplement had no impact on heart disease or cancer. Vitamin D did not affect cardiovascular disease or cancer either. However, the study concluded that vitamin D \u201cappears to lower the risk of cancer death.\u201d So when specifically looking at the COVID-19 coronavirus, maintaining vitamin D adequacy may be important to people who contract the virus. Dr. Boyd said his recommendation is for 2,000 international units of vitamin D3 per day. He added that even though it may not prevent someone from getting coronavirus, it may \u201cmake the disease less likely to be serious.\u201d Vitamin C He also said that Americans can take 250 milligrams of vitamin C \u2014 it won\u2019t hurt them. Some multivitamins will give an individual around 60 mg of vitamin C, which may provide an adequate level for healthy people. He told Heavy, \u201cI believe that if you are sick, or if you\u2019re older, you may need higher levels of vitamin C. When levels of 20 to 30 milligrams are not adequate, maybe you need 200 to even 500 milligrams a day of vitamin C.\u201d According to Dr. Boyd, if someone decides to take vitamin C, they should make sure to get it with a low dose of zinc. Herbal Dietary Supplements Dr. Boyd recommended that people avoid herbal products like Echinacea because there are controversial studies about the product having a negative impact on the immune response and its possibility of interacting with other medications. He pointed out that elderberry has been in a few influenza studies and it was shown to reduce the severity and the duration of symptoms. However, those studies are very limited and it could be too soon to draw conclusions from them.

Qualified naturopath Lisa Guy shares a seven day attack-plan for supercharging your immunity, with a daily focus on the key vitamins and minerals that will help protect you, and your family, from illness. With only one thing to focus on each day, it's an achievable way of improving your body's natural defence mechanisms agains infection and hopefully will make you feel better too. Mentally, and physically. Day 1: Monday Get more garlic. Source: iStockSource:BodyAndSoul Aim: get more garlic It has the powerful compound allicin, vitamins A, C, E and minerals selenium, sulfur and zinc (all vital to immune function). It also protects against infections, colds and flu, and has anti-bacterial, -fungal and -viral properties. Just add crushed cloves to pastas, sauces, salad dressings and dips. Day 2: Tuesday Swap popcorn for seaweed snacks. Image: iStock.Source:BodyAndSoul Aim: slip in a superfood Seaweed is not only extremely nutritious, it boosts the immune system and reduces the risk of illness and infection. Seaweed is a good source of zinc and antioxidants that are important for immune health. Add strips of kelp, nori, or akrame to soups, salads and stir-fries. Day 3: Wednesday Get outdoors to get some sun. Source: iStockSource:BodyAndSoul Aim: get some sun Vitamin D protects us against illness and a range of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Sunlight is the easiest and healthiest way to get sufficient vitamin D, so aim for 10 to 15 minutes a day (without sunscreen), on the face, arms and hands. Day 4: Thursday Echinacea can help reduce the symptoms of the flu. Image: iStock.Source:BodyAndSoul Aim: take echinacea regularly It has phenolic compounds which increase the activity and number of immune cells such as macrophages and T-cells, making them more efficient in attacking bacteria and viruses such as colds and flu. Take echinacea in tablets, as fluid extracts or in tea (three cups a day is ideal). Day 5: Friday Fresh oranges are a tasty source of vitamin C. Image: Pexels.Source:BodyAndSoul Aim: boost your vitamin C Vitamin C is one of the best immune-boosting nutrients for treating and preventing all illnesses and chronic diseases. As a powerful antioxidant, it protects cells from free-radical damage, and has antiviral, antibacterial and anti-allergenic activity. Eat more citrus, parsley, berries, red capsicum and kiwifruit. Day 6: Saturday Fruit and yoghurt is a smart combo. Image: iStock.Source:BodyAndSoul Aim: eat some yoghurt This highly nutritious fermented food has the ability to improve digestion and boost our immune health. The live bacteria (acidophilus and bifidus) promote the health and growth of friendly bowel bacteria. Look for the \"live and active cultures or bacteria\" seal on the yoghurt you buy. Day 7: Sunday Dairy is a good source of zinc. Image: iStockSource:BodyAndSoul Aim: think zinc It's needed for the production of white blood cells which protect against colds and infections. Zinc has antioxidant activity, helping to fight free- radical damage, and is found in meats, dairy and wholegrains, but it's lost in processing. If supplementing with tablets, take about 45 milligrams a day. Lisa Guy is a Sydney-based author and naturopath with over 16 years clinical experience. She is also the founder of Bodhi tea.

Boling, a family physician at Mercy Medical Center, told UPI. \"That means taking your medications as directed, exercising and eating well. If you have high blood pressure, for example, now is not the time to slacking off on your diet and eating a lot of salty foods.\" A study published in The Lancet, which reviewed the cases of 191 people with COVID-19, found that those with high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease were more likely to have severe disease, require hospitalization for care or die than people who were otherwise healthy when they became infected. In all, 54 of the 191 patients in the study \u2014 all of whom were from Wuhan, China, epicenter of the outbreak \u2014 died, and two thirds had at least one other health condition before getting sick. According to the authors, 26 had high blood pressure, 17 had diabetes, 13 had heart disease and four had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. \"All of these conditions, and other chronic disease, can suppress your immune system's ability to mount a defense against a virus like COVID-19,\" Boling said. \"When people say those who are immune suppressed are at greater risk, they mean somebody who is undergoing chemotherapy, or has HIV or people who have rheumatoid arthritis who are taking immuno-suppressor medications. Pregnant women are also a little immune suppressed.\" People who are 65 and older also don't have the same immune defenses they once did, which is why seniors get a high-dose flu vaccine every year, she added. Still, those who fall into one or more high risk groups \u2014 more than 30 million Americans have diabetes, while more than 100 million have high blood pressure \u2014 can help minimize their risk by living a healthy lifestyle. A balanced, nutritious diet, regular exercise and getting enough sleep can go a long way to optimizing the immune system to fight off infection, whether it's the flu or something more serious. People can also make changes that enhance immune system function. For example, eating a low-carbohydrate diet with plenty of different-colored fruits and vegetables helps supply the immune system with the antioxidants and anti-inflammatory phytonutrients it needs to fight infection. A high-fiber diet, including grains and yogurt, can strengthen the gut microbiome \u2014 or so-called \"good bacteria\" in the digestive tract \u2014 and bolster immune defenses. Boling recommends that all her patients take up to 2000 IUs of vitamin D daily. Vitamin D has been shown to play a role in immune health, she said, and many people don't get adequate amounts of it in their diets.

Smith, Ph.D., R.D.N., Entr\u00e9e Tribune Content Agency | Mar 20, 2020 | 1:16 PM With cold and flu viruses seemingly stronger than ever, the thought may have crossed your mind more than once: How to boost your immune system? Studies have proven that these three dietary supplements are among the most effective at enhancing your immunity to infectious diseases. 1. Echinacea Advertisement There are nine different species of Echinacea, although three are used for medicinal purposes: Echinacea angustifolia, Echinacea pallida and Echinacea purpura. Echinacea purpura extract is widely used to help deal with various infectious diseases, especially in children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. Echinacea has various medicinal properties. First, it is antimicrobial against pathogens such as viruses and bacteria that cause colds, flu, sore throats, and other respiratory illnesses. However, it has been shown to enhance the growth of gut flora (healthy bacteria in the gut), specifically increasing the healthy Bifidobacterium species. Therefore, echinacea may enhance the effects of priobiotics containing Bifidobacterium. Echinacea also has anti-inflammatory properties, supports wound healing, and has been shown to improve the immune system's resistance against infection. 2. Vitamin C and zinc Several cells of the immune system accumulate vitamin C and need the vitamin to perform their tasks, especially phagocytes and T-cells. And, zinc has been demonstrated to fight infections and help heal wounds. Despite these therapeutic properties, for quite some time there has been a controversy on whether vitamin C and zinc can contribute to the prevention and therapy of the common cold. However, a large number of randomized controlled intervention trials have settled this debate. These trials document that adequate intakes of vitamin C (up to 1 g) and zinc (up to 30 mg) ameliorate symptoms and shorten the duration of respiratory tract infections, including the common cold. Furthermore, vitamin C and zinc reduce the incidence and improve the outcome of pneumonia, malaria and diarrhea infections. (Dreamstime/TNS) 3. Black elderberry Most Read Gov. Cuomo places New York on \u2018pause\u2019 as coronavirus cases soar above 8,500 Drone walks dog for man on coronavirus lockdown in Cyprus NY Gov. Cuomo presses \u2018pause\u2019 by imposing tough new controls as coronavirus spirals to 7,100 cases and 35 deaths The elderberry plant, Sambucus nigra, is a good source of protein, amino acids, unsaturated fatty acids, fiber, vitamins and minerals. In addition, elderberry contains antioxidants called polyphenols, mostly in the form of anthocyanins, flavonols, phenolic acids and proanthocyanidins, as well as terpenes and lectins. The antioxidant effect of the polyphenols in elderberry has been shown to have beneficial effects on blood pressure, glycemia (blood sugar) reduction, and immune system stimulation with anti-viral and even anti-tumor potential. In commercially made elderberry syrups, the dosage is often two teaspoons per day. As always, discuss the use of supplements with your care provider before adding it to your regimen.

The Associated Press \u2022 April 4, 2020 12:20 pm A roundup of some of the most popular but completely untrue stories and visuals of the week. None of these are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked them out. Here are the facts: Claim: Eating alkaline foods will stave off the novel coronavirus, which has a pH level of 5.5 to 8.5. The facts: A false post circulating on social media claims that COVID-19 has a pH level between 5.5 to 8.5, and in order to fend off the virus people must consume alkaline foods. Both points are false. First, a virus does not have a pH level. Second, the body\u2019s pH levels cannot be changed through diet. \u201cA virus itself does not have a pH,\u201d said Sarah Stanley, associate professor of infectious diseases and vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health. Stanley explained in an email that \u201cpH is something that applies to a water based solution, which a virus is not.\u201d In addition, she said, it\u2019s not possible for diet to change the pH of blood, cells or tissues. The body regulates pH levels; it\u2019s not something a person would want to change. \u201cEating a healthy and balanced diet supports immunity and can be helpful for fighting off infections. However, there is no evidence that consuming alkaline foods specifically is beneficial,\u201d she said. The post cites the \u201cJournal of Virology & Antiviral Research\u201d and states: \u201cThis is to inform us all that the pH for corona virus varies from 5.5 to 8.5. All we need to do, to beat coronavirus, we need to take more of an alkaline foods that are above the pH level of the virus.\u201d It lists a number of foods to fight off the novel coronavirus, including lemons, limes and pineapples, but the pH levels provided for them are incorrect. For example, it gives a pH level of 9 for lemons and a level of 9.2 for limes, when both have a pH of about 2, a food science specialist noted. \u201cThese pH values for these foods are completely wrong,\u201d Donald Schaffner, extension specialist in food science at Rutgers University, told the AP. \u201cThe human body is designed to be really good at maintaining its pH.\u201d Schaffner said people should eat those foods if they want, but \u201cthe best way to keep from getting a virus is to stay away from people.\u201d Claim: Drinking alcoholic beverages can prevent coronavirus. The facts: A Facebook post with the caption \u201cTime to disinfect our insides\u201d featured a fabricated memo made to appear like a recommendation from a Kansas City hospital that drinking alcoholic beverages would reduce the risk of coronavirus. The manufactured memo attributed to St. Luke\u2019s Hospital said, \u201cAfter extensive research, our findings show that consuming alcoholic beverages may help reduce the risk of infection by the novel coronavirus; COVID-19. Vodka is the most recommended for drinking, cleaning, and sanitizing.\u201d Saint Luke\u2019s Health System, a hospital network that includes the hospital in Kansas City, Missouri, issued a statement in response on March 11, stating: \u201cFalse reports are circulating that say drinking alcohol can reduce the risk of COVID-19. THIS IS NOT TRUE. Saint Luke\u2019s follows CDC guidance.\u201d The hospital suggests practicing good hand hygiene, washing hands for at least 20 seconds, and when soap and water is not available, using a hand sanitizer that is at least 60 percent alcohol. Dr. Robert Legare Atmar, an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College, said consuming alcohol will not protect against infectious diseases like COVID-19. \u201cAlcohol consumption has long been touted as a means to prevent infection with a variety of pathogens, but there is no evidence that such alcohol consumption protects against any infection,\u201d Dr. Atmar told the AP in an email. \u201cIn fact, the evidence is often the opposite \u2013- that alcohol consumption is associated with increased risk of infection.\u201d Claim: Put a small pea-sized amount of antibiotic ointment like mupirocin inside your nostrils. The ointment will kill any infectious germs when you breathe and should kill the coronavirus before it gets to your lungs. The facts: The antibiotic ointment will not protect you from the coronavirus. Antibacterial medications like mupirocin will only help fight off bacteria like staphylococcus and streptococcus, not COVID-19, which is a virus, said Dr. Daniela Kroshinsky, director of inpatient dermatology at Massachusetts General Hospital. \u201cThe most important steps to prevent infection with COVID are physical distancing, good hand washing, and avoiding touching your face,\u201d she said in an email. The false posts circulating online, which included a photo of mupirocin, recommended that people protect themselves and others by putting a \u201csmall pea-sized amount on the tip of a Q-tip\u201d and swabbing the inside of their nostrils. Dr. Carrie Kovarik, an associate professor of dermatology at the University of Pennsylvania, said mupirocin can be used in the nose of patients who have bacterial infections like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, also known as MRSA. \u201cIt\u2019s an antibiotic not an antiviral and does not have activity against viruses,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are just sort of grasping at straws.\u201d Claim: Israel has had no deaths from coronavirus because people in the country have been cured by drinking hot water with lemon and bicarbonate of soda at night. The facts: The drink is not a cure for the coronavirus, and there have been deaths attributed to the coronavirus in Israel. As of Friday, Israel had confirmed more than 7,030 cases of the virus and 39 deaths. Posts predominantly shared on Facebook and WhatsApps falsely state that \u201cthe action of the lemon with hotter baking soda immediately kills the virus, completely eliminates it from the body.\u201d Dr. Shira Doron, an infectious disease physician and hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center, told The Associated Press that nothing should be presumed to prevent or treat the virus unless it has gone through clinical trials. \u201cThere are no herbal remedies I would recommend for COVID-19,\u201d she said. Medical experts have said that developing a vaccine for the virus could take at least 12 to 18 months. Dr. Doron recommends that people keep a well-rounded healthy diet, get sleep and minimize their stress, because those factors affect the immune system. Claim: The proper way to wear a medical mask is with the colored side on the outside if you are sick and don\u2019t want to spread your germs and with the white side out if you\u2019re not sick and want to stop germs from getting in. The facts: Medical officials say the colored side of the mask should be worn on the outside, away from your face, regardless of whether you are sick or healthy. Social media users have been sharing the false claim since January, but it recently gained prominence in the U.S. as more Americans consider wearing face masks in an effort to protect themselves from the new coronavirus. Dr. Seto Wing Hong, co-director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, said in January that the correct way to wear a mask is with the blue side on the outside and the white side on your face. \u201cYou see it has the blue color on the outside because it is waterproof and then you have white on the inside because it is absorbent,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, if I cough, it absorbs it.\u201d Surgical face masks like the one shown with the false claim online typically have a blue side and a white side. One post on Twitter with the false claim had 80,000 likes. The post shows a document from someone who says they went to a doctor\u2019s office and a nurse taught them how to properly wear a medical mask depending if they are sick or healthy. The document includes two photos of women wearing masks. \u201cColored side out if you are sick and do not want to spread your germs around. White side out (this is the filter part) for when you\u2019re not sick and you want to stop germs from getting in,\u201d the document reads. Experts stressed it is best to follow the instructions from the mask supplier. Claim: Just three days after Attorney General William Barr announced the Department of Justice will prosecute hoarders of personal protective equipment needed to combat the coronavirus, a California union suddenly located a stockpile of 39 million N95 masks. The facts: That\u2019s not what happened. The United Health Care Workers West chapter of the Service Employees International Union simply connected state governments and hospitals to a vendor. The union did not have a stockpile of masks. Social media posts that the California union was hoarding crucial medical supplies followed President Donald Trump\u2019s March 23 signing of an order making it a crime to stockpile personal protective equipment needed by medical workers fighting the coronavirus pandemic. Barr also announced his agency was investigating people who were hoarding or price gouging medical supplies. Three days after the signing, the Services Employees International Union chapter announced it was connecting several counties in California, the state, and hospital networks with a vendor that could provide 39 million N95 masks. Fringe news sites and social media posts falsely suggested the union had been hoarding the masks all along, only handing them over once the federal government had threatened to prosecute such activity. \u201cHmm \u2026 SEIU Union in California Suddenly Finds Mysterious Stash of 39 Million Face Masks \u2014 3 Days After AG Bill Barr Announces They\u2019re Going After Hoarders,\u201d one headline stated. The union didn\u2019t stock or sell the masks, Steve Trossman, a spokesman for the union chapter, confirmed to The Associated Press. It searched for leads and potential suppliers for the masks. \u201cWe had nothing to do with the transactions,\u201d Trossman said. \u201cWe found suppliers, we had hospitals and health systems that needed supplies and connected them.\u201d Brian Ferguson, a spokesman for the California governor\u2019s emergency services office, also confirmed to the AP that the state bought them from a vendor. Claim: If you are in Las Vegas and you get a knock on your door from Nevada Power, 2020 Census or COVID-19 testers do NOT open your door! They are robbing people at gunpoint. The facts: No verified reports of such criminal activity have occurred in the city, the Las Vegas Police Department confirmed to The Associated Press. Facebook posts are spreading an old hoax that homeowners shouldn\u2019t answer the door if they get a knock from people claiming to represent certain government agencies. The U.S. Census Bureau has seen false reports of criminals posing as census workers hoping to rob anyone who answers the door since last year. A new twist on the unsubstantiated report circulating in recent days on Facebook warned Las Vegas residents not to answer the door for someone offering to swab for the coronavirus, or claiming to be from the U.S. Census Bureau or Nevada\u2019s public utility. \u201cThere are no verified reports of this going on in the Las Vegas valley,\u201d a spokesman for the Las Vegas Police Department said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press. The Census Bureau, which has repeatedly knocked down online hoaxes that people are impersonating census workers and robbing homes, has delayed dispatching census workers to collect answers to the once-every-decade survey until April 29 because of the coronavirus pandemic. This is part of The Associated Press\u2019 ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform. \u00a0 ...

(Mr. Healthy/YouTube/CBC) A Facebook post and a video with a robotic voice-over both cite the expert advice of Chinese researcher Jiao Shenme Minzi. The first clue is his name, which can roughly be translated from Mandarin into\u00a0\"What is your name.\" Minzi doesn't appear to exist, nor does the university where he purportedly works.\u00a0 The video then claims that lemon in hot water \"destroys the virus and cures the flu.\" It attributes this to Prof. Chen Horin at the Beijing Military Hospital. An institution of that exact name does not appear to exist, and neither does Horin. \"It's very easy to blind with credentials,\" says\u00a0Jonathan Jarry, a biologist at McGill University, using names of doctors and institutions that may or may not exist. \"But if something is indeed true, you would expect public health agencies to embrace these ideas.\" MYTH 2: Steam and heat kills the virus in your body One video claims you can use heat on your nasal area to kill the virus. Experts say while heat can sometimes be used to kill viruses on surfaces, it doesn't work when the virus has already infected you. (Facebook/CBC) One such video quotes a Dr. Dan Lee Dimke, author of a 1984 book titled\u00a0Conquer the Common Cold & Flu. According to his \"about the author,\" he is not a medical doctor, but he claims to have become a lecturing astronomer at age 10 and\u00a0a college teacher by age 17, and to have the ability to read 25,000 words per minute.\u00a0 The video says coronaviruses are vulnerable to heat, and claims the virus only lives in the coolest part of your body, which it identifies as the nose and sinuses. It recommends breathing\u00a0in hot air from a hair dryer or in a hot-weather locale.\u00a0\u00a0 Jarry, who specializes in communicating science, says it can be difficult to discern that\u00a0the video's main claim is false.\u00a0 CBC InvestigatesChiropractors chided for claims of boosting immunity and preventing COVID-19 \"In a lot of these pseudoscientific videos, there is a kernel of truth. There's something there that is true, and it is true that viruses can be inactivated using heat,\" said Jarry, noting there's some evidence that steam vapour can disinfect surfaces.\u00a0 \"But there's a very big difference between sanitizing a surface and sanitizing yourself, because the virus is not just waiting \u2026 in your nostrils. It's further down your airways.\" MYTH 3: You can make your own N-95 mask It's not possible to make your own N-95 mask at home out of a bra. While you can make a mask for your face, a bra cup can't filter out minute particles the way an N-95 mask can. (Rebecca Brand/YouTube/CBC) People are circulating do-it-yourself video tutorials, including one 20-minute-long instruction on turning a bra into a\u00a0supposed N-95 mask that's been viewed\u00a0more than a million times on YouTube. It was made by a woman who has dozens of other videos on recipes, dieting and beauty tips. At one point she claims, \"Natural materials like cotton and wool naturally repel viruses. I had to find that out on the internet!\" There is no evidence that claim is true. She provides no\u00a0sources for her information and doesn't warn her audience that her method would not be as effective as an actual N-95 mask. She concludes by saying, \"I think this might really help a lot of people.\" But good intentions can be dangerous, van der Linden says. \"Perhaps somebody who honestly thinks that they're contributing by doing something useful is actually spreading misinformation in the sense that these masks won't help people. And if they do think they help them, they go on to get sick. And so it could have serious consequences,\" he says.\u00a0 WATCH |\u00a0Experts warn about products claiming to cure, prevent coronavirus From standing on your head, to drinking a special herbal tea -- experts are warning Canadians against falling for phony cures for COVID-19. 1:54 There may not be consensus\u00a0on whether a mask of any kind could provide some measure of protection, but Dr. Jen Gunter, an obstetrician-gynecologist who frequently debunks pseudoscientific medical claims, says homemade masks can't compare to an actual N-95 mask, even if they are similar in shape to a bra cup.\u00a0 \"It's nothing to do with the shape. You know, N-95s filter out at least 95 per cent of particles that are smaller than\u00a0\u2014\u00a0I think it's point three microns,\" she said. \"And the fabric that's used in them, the very specific mesh, is very difficult to make.\" MYTH 4: A breath test can detect\u00a0coronavirus A picture of a sheet of paper that offers a simple test for COVID-19: holding your breath for more than 10 seconds. (Facebook) A printed sheet\u00a0of instructions lays\u00a0out\u00a0how to test yourself for coronavirus infection by holding your breath, and encourages readers to perform the daily test created by \"experts\" in Taiwan. The paper claims that\u00a0if a person can hold their breath for more than 10 seconds without coughing or discomfort, that's proof there is\u00a0no infection.\u00a0 \"If it were that simple, we wouldn't be hearing on the news day in, day out that we are running out of test kits for COVID-19,\" Jarry said. \"If you can successfully hold your breath, you could still have the virus and be contagious.\" \"And again,\" Gunter said, \"apart from the fact that that's incorrect, this makes other information about the virus harder for us to get out to people.\"\u00a0 MYTH 5: Drinking warm water, gargling salt water can\u00a0protect you This forwarded email urges people to repeatedly drink water or gargle throughout the day to unblock their airways and prevent them from getting sick. (CBC) A chain email is going around attributing a list of things you can do to protect yourself \u2014 like drink warm water every 20 minutes and gargle with salt water \u2014 to a friend of a friend who is \"connected in China health care.\" The email claims you have to regularly unblock your airways by drinking liquids to keep yourself safe.\u00a0 Using the old method of a chain letter, these types of messages spread easily among friends on WhatsApp or Facebook \"because a person who is giving you the information is already somebody that you trust,\" said Jarry. Email, text message attacks surge during COVID-19 crisis No, the new coronavirus wasn't created in a lab, scientists say But, he added, \"If you don't know who the actual primary source is, it's very difficult to assess the accuracy.\" These recommendations, says Gunter, are \"absolutely not true.\" \"But I can see when there's so much uncertainty how something that's almost a bit\u00a0ritualistic ... could make people feel comfortable. And the problem is, is when\u00a0there's nothing to do except hand-washing and stay inside, that people look for something concrete to do.\" How to evaluate COVID-19 advice you spot online First, pause. Don't share anything, especially out of fear, before you have had a chance to evaluate the claim. Take a look at where the information is coming from. Texts from \"friends of friends\" or unnamed hospital workers\u00a0are likely to contain false information. Google it. You can enter\u00a0the words you're interested in searching, like \"lemon water and coronavirus\" and the words \"fact-check\" into a search engine and see what you get for results. Often claims have already been debunked and you will be able to find those results quickly. If it sounds too good to be true, it likely is. There is, as yet, no approved drug therapy\u00a0or\u00a0vaccine for COVID-19. Also be skeptical of products and practices that claim to boost immune function or detoxify your body or organs. Check the names and credentials of people cited as experts. For example, it's easy to verify that Dr. Theresa Tam is Canada's chief public health officer. But sometimes so-called experts are\u00a0speaking outside their area of expertise.\u00a0Is a physicist giving you information about mask wearing? They may not be a reliable source of information. When in doubt, don't share information.\u00a0 You may be spreading misinformation and causing others to panic needlessly.

The Pofessor of IPB University who is also the Head of the Center for Tropical Biopharmaca (TropBRC), Prof. Irmanida Batubara explained that the compound is a flavonoid group, one of which is hesperidin. Hesperidin is allegedly able to provide protection against microbes and viruses. \u201cWhere can we get this compound? This compound is found in orange peel. So, while staying at home, we can make orange juice and don\u2019t forget to add a little orange peel that has been washed clean. It will taste a little bitter. Now, hold on to this bitterness because it shows that hesperidin is in it, \u201cIrmanida said as a press statement received by MINA, Monday. For those who are less able to consume the bitter, he continued, can make an infusion of water from oranges and their skin. Some compounds of orange peel will dissolve in water so it is also consumed by us. Don\u2019t forget the oranges are washed clean first. \u201cAll types of oranges contain hesperidin. So, it does not have to be a citrus fruit, we can also use the skin of lime, lemon and other citrus varieties, \u201cadded Irmanida. Now, the COVID-19 epidemic is rife everywhere. Many ways that we can do include washing hands frequently with soap, keeping a social distance, staying at home and others. Maintaining health so it is not easily attacked by this virus is certainly an inseparable part for us to do.

False: Different Types Of Tea Can Act As A Cure For COVID-19 Caffeine in tea is known to reduce drowsiness and fatigue but there is no scientific evidence about its impact on COVID-19 BannedfortalkinBy - Shachi Sutaria Loading...\u00a0 | \u00a03 April 2020 10:14 AM GMT Viral messages claiming that tea prepared with different ingredients is a tested cure for COVID-19, the deadly disease caused by the Coronavirus, are false. The World Health Organization has stated that there has been no treatment approved nor any medical prevention protocol to tackle the COVID-19, so far. The two messages making the claim are as follows: 1. Tea made with lemon and bicarbonate (baking soda) alkalize the immune system as it becomes acidic in the night and that Israel has no deaths as Israelis regularly drink this concoction. The claim is false on two counts as there is no scientific evidence of this concoction changing the PH levels in the body and Israel has over 7,000 confirmed cases and 36 deaths (so far) due to COVID-19 as reported by Johns Hopkins University. 2. The second message claims Dr Li Wenliang, the Chinese whistleblower doctor who first raised alarm bells about a new virus and who died in detention, had also found a cure for Coronavirus in the form of green tea which was actively being given to the patients in Wuhan. The whistleblower who died due to COVID-19 in February had only informed about the emergence of a new virus and there is no evidence of him having found a cure for the Coronavirus. Furthermore, there is no scientific evidence stating that the compounds in green tea can cure COVID-19. Both the posts are actively being shared on WhatsApp and Facebook. BOOM received these messages several times on its helpline numbers. BOOM has debunked several posts in the past suggesting prevention and cures for the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus. Also Read:Boiled Garlic Water For Treating Coronavirus? Not Really Also Read: Did Italians Throw Their Money On The Streets Due To COVID-19 Deaths? The WHO has repeatedly stated that medicines and vaccines are being developed and are being used on experimental basis to tackle COVID-19. The disease currently has no prescribed prevention or treatment protocol. Fact Check Claim: 'Drink a mixture of lemon and bicarbonate as hot tea which kills the virus and alkalize the immune system as at night the body becomes acidic. Israelis are not worried and the country has no deaths as they drink this tea'. The claim that the Israelis are not worried and that the country has no deaths is false. According to Johns Hopkins University's COVID-19 dashboard, the country has 36 deaths and over 7,000 cases as of April 3,2020. The health minister of Israel tested positive on April 2, 2020. The claim that the mixture of lemon and baking soda (bicarbonate) kills the virus is not scientifically accurate. US-based fact-checking website Snopes debunked this claim earlier. Human body's normal pH levels are 7. pH levels decide the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. The human blood with a pH of 7.4 is alkaline whereas the stomach is acidic as it breaks down food and aids in digestion. Lemons are rich in vitamin C whose effect on respiratory tract viruses has been actively debated over the years. The National Institutes of Health in the United States eventually stated that regular uptake of 200mg/day of vitamin C does not affect the common cold causing virus. A single lemon has merely 30 mg of vitamin C. Furthermore, the body's pH levels are not that easily changed unless kept in optimum laboratory conditions or if a person is suffering from chronic health conditions like acidosis. Regular diet or intake of acid-rich foods have not been seen to change the body's acidic or alkaline levels. The claim that bicarbonate with lemon will have any effect on the current strain of Coronavirus is thus not backed by scientific research. Claim: 'Dr Li. Wenliang had proposed a cure of methylxanthine, theobromine and theophylline stimulant compounds found in green tea which was given to patients in Wuhan' Dr. Li Wenliang was the whistleblower of the virus who was apprehended and put into prison after he raised his voice about the emergence of a new virus in China. He lost his life to Coronavirus in February but there is no evidence stating that he discovered a cure for COVID-19. Alongside, these compounds that are found in green teas have their own properties but have not been scientifically or micro biologically proven to impact the coronavirus. Caffeine is a type of methylxanthine and helps in good airway control but has not been seen to affect viral infections. This concoction is also known to reduce drowsiness and fatigue but high consumption could also lead to headache and tremors. There is no known cure for COVID-19 so far. The recovered cases are on case-to-case basis and depend on the individual's immune response. All the medications that are being used including anti-HIV drugs, are on an experimental basis and cannot be labelled as cures yet.

The claim is misleading; the World Health Organization (WHO) says drinking water does not prevent novel coronavirus infection; Japan has not issued a health advisory listing drinking water as a prevention method for COVID-19. The post was published here on Facebook on February 28, 2020. It has been shared more than 400 times. Below is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post: Screenshot of Facebook post The post reads, in part: \"SERIOUS EXCELLENT ADVICE by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases. Everyone should ensure your mouth & throat is moist, never DRY. Take a few sips of water every 15 mins at least. WHY? Even if the virus gets into your mouth...drinking water or other liquids will WASH them down through your oesophagus and into the stomach.

Tell us about any questionable or concerning rumors and \u201cadvice\u201d you encounter here. A significant amount of COVID-19 coronavirus disease misinformation spreading across social media or chat apps takes the form of copied-and-pasted \u201cadvice\u201d posts attributed to anonymous \u201cexperts\u201d. These posts are usually riddled with scientific errors and/or promises of cures. Here we look at two such \u201ccure\u201d posts that involve hot water and lemons. The Claims One claim, attributed to a Chinese researcher, implores readers to \u201cuse as much natural vitamin C\u201d as possible and suggests lemons as a good source. To that point, the post claims that regular consumption of a drink made from three lemon slices and hot water helps \u201cagainst the spread of [COVID-19]\u201d and \u201cdestroys the virus.\u201d While vitamin C does play a role in several immune system functions, its use as a treatment to prevent or cure viral infections is unsupported by science. A second, slightly modified claim is attributed to \u201cinformation\u201d that \u201ccomes from Israel\u201d and includes the addition of sodium bicarbonate to the hot lemon water cure. Unlike the previous assertion, which rests largely on claims about vitamin C, this cure allegedly works because it can \u201calkalize the immune system.\u201d The ubiquity of this concoction in Israel, the post additionally claims, is why the country has seen no cases of the disease. This is false. \u201cAlkalizing the immune system\u201d is an illogical pseudoscientific concept, and at this time of this reporting, Israel had over 2,300 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Can Hot Lemon \u2018Kill the Spread of This Virus\u2019? This dubious claim, which now circulates in text form on social media platforms, has its origins in a video shared extensively on Facebook messenger and created by the owner of the YouTube channel \u201cMrHealthyChannel.\u201d Even before any medical information is presented, several red flags are apparent. \u201cHi, I am Jiao Shenme Mingzi from China, Researcher at the School of Medicine Zanjan University,\u201d the post begins. Zanjan University is in Iran, and, as PolitiFact noted, this person\u2019s alleged name closely resembles the phonetic spelling of \u201cjiao shenme mingzi,\u201d which is not a name but a phrase used to ask for someone\u2019s name. The video and posts derived from transcripts of that video falsely assert that the reason we lack a medical cure for COVID-19, and therefore need a natural remedy that contains vitamin C, is a result of the novel coronavirus\u2019 unexpected or rapid genetic mutation (an issue Snopes addressed here). In reality, this virus is dangerous because of its ability, like other infection-causing viruses, to sustain and replicate in human cells, particularly those of the upper respiratory system. Though early work had suggested vitamin C as a treatment for the common cold, which is also a viral upper respiratory infection, later work has cast doubt on that notion. In general, no scientific research has shown an ability for vitamin C supplementation to \u201ckill\u201d any upper-respiratory system virus or to reduce its spread. As summarized by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), \u201cthe evidence to date suggests that regular intakes of vitamin C at doses of at least 200 mg/per day do not reduce the incidence of the common cold in the general population.\u201d For reference, that single lemon cut into three slices and served with hot water contains about 30 milligrams of vitamin c. The NIH does suggest that \u201cvitamin C supplements might shorten the duration of the common cold and ameliorate symptom severity\u201d as well as provide some potential benefit to certain populations of people with compromised immune systems. As Dr. Caroline Apovian, a professor of medicine and pediatrics at the Boston University School of Medicine, explained to USA Today, \u201cThe only impact that vitamins and supplements may have in any cold or flu is to lessen the severity.\u201d\u00a0 As such, the assertion that a single lemon served with hot water will \u201ckill the spread of this virus in our body\u201d is unsupported by science. Can Lemon Help \u2018Alkalize the Immune System\u2019? This iteration of the lemon and hot water cure comes from a viral copy-pasted-and-reshared bit of text on Facebook that usually begins with the false statement that the information comes \u201cfrom Israel where this virus did not cause any deaths.\u201d As previously noted, Israel has in no way been immune to the coronavirus pandemic, nor are they, as the post also asserts, \u201crelaxed about the virus.\u201d On March 25, the Israeli government announced \u2014 like other governments around the world \u2014 measures to limit the movement of its citizens in order to slow the disease\u2019s spread. The alleged science here is just as straightforward to debunk. The ability to \u201calkalize\u201d one\u2019s body was a popular claim promoted by scientists in the 1920s and by supplement peddlers and health gurus today. But unless you suffer from certain specific and medically catastrophic conditions like metabolic acidosis, it is effectively impossible to alter, through diet, the pH of the cellular environment that makes up the various tissues of your body, including those of the immune system. The body maintains these environments in a tightly controlled range: a pH between 7.36 and 7.44 in arteries, and around 7.2 in intracellular spaces. The only pH value in your body that you would be altering with your diet is the pH of your urine. Such a modification would provide no medical benefit to the fight against a viral infection. The Bottom Line Lemon and hot water used as a vitamin C therapy will not \u201ckill\u201d or \u201cslow the spread\u201d of COVID-19, nor would it provide a clinically significant amount of vitamin C to begin with. A buffered solution of hot lemon juice and sodium bicarbonate, similarly, will do nothing to change the pH of either your body or your immune system. For these reasons both lemon-related \u201ccures\u201d are rated \u201cFalse.\u201d Snopes.com Since 1994 Help Supercharge Snopes For 2020 We have big plans. We need your help. Become a member!
